Code of Conduct
===============


Introduction
------------

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the NetworkX project,
including all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, and
any other communication channel used by our community.

This code of conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in
the NetworkX community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the
project, in any project-related activities and especially when representing the
project, in any role.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common
understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. Please try to
follow this code in spirit as much as in letter, to create a friendly and
productive environment that enriches the surrounding community.

We have adapted the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct to allow people with some separation
and some training to further the Code of Conduct goals.

The Short Version
-----------------

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally.
Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not
appropriate for NumFOCUS.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including
people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not
appropriate.

NumFOCUS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not
tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
