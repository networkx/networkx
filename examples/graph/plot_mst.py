Minimum Spanning Tree
=====================

A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of edges in a weighted, 
connected graph that connects all vertices together with the 
minimum possible total edge weight. The `minimum_spanning_tree`
function is used to compare the original graph with its MST.
