""" Complement graph class for small footprint when working on dense graphs.

This class allows you to add the edges that *do not exist* in the dense 
graph. However, when applying algorithms to this complement graph data 
structure, it behaves as if it were the dense version. So it can be used
directly in several NetworkX algorithms.

This subclass has only been tested for k-core, connected_components,
and biconnected_components algorithms but might also work for other
algorithms.

    Class for complement graphs.

    The main goal is to be able to work with big and dense graphs with
    a low memory foodprint.

    In this class you add the edges that *do not exist* in the dense graph,
    the report methods of the class return the neighbors, the edges and 
    the degree as if it was the dense graph. Thus it's possible to use
    an instance of this class with some of NetworkX functions.
