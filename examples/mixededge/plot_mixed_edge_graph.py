====================================================
MixedEdgeGraph - Graph with different types of edges
====================================================

A ``MixedEdgeGraph`` is a graph comprised of a tuple, :math:`G = (V, E)`.
The difference compared to the other networkx graphs are the edges, E.
``E`` is comprised of a set of mixed edges defined by the user. This
allows arbitrary representation of graphs with different types of edges.
The ``MixedEdgeGraph`` class represents each type of edge using an internal
graph that is one of ``nx.Graph`` or ``nx.DiGraph`` classes. Each internal graph
represents one type of edge. 

Semantically a ``MixedEdgeGraph`` with just one type of edge, is just a normal
``nx.Graph` or ``nx.DiGraph`` and should be converted to its appropriate
networkx class.

For example, causal graphs typically have two types of edges:

- ``->`` directed edges representing causal relations
- ``<->`` bidirected edges representing the presence of an unobserved
  confounder.

This would type of mixed-edge graph with two internal graphs: a ``nx.DiGraph``
to represent the directed edges, and a ``nx.Graph`` to represent the bidirected
edges.

# Mixed Edge Graph Properties

# Mixed Edge Graph Operations on Nodes
# ------------------------------------

# Nodes: Similar to ``nx.Graph`` and ``nx.DiGraph``, the nodes of the graph
# can be queried via the same API. By default nodes are stored
# inside every internal graph.
nodes = G.nodes
assert G.order() == len(G)

# Now, we can remove the node
G.remove_node("A")
print(f"Graph has node A: {G.has_node('A')}")

# %%
# Mixed Edge Graph Operations on Edges
# ------------------------------------
# Mixed edge graphs are just like normal networkx graph classes,
# except that they store an internal networkx graph per edge type.
# As a result, each edge now corresponds to an 'edge_type', which
# typically must be specified in edge operations for mixed edge graphs.

# Edges: We can query specific edges by type
print(f"The graph has directed edges: {G.edges()['directed']}")

# Note these edges correspond to the edges of the internal networkx
# DiGraph that represents the directed edges
print(G.get_graphs("directed").edges())

# When querying, adding, or removing an edge, you must specify
# the edge type as well.
# Here, we can add a new Z <-> Y bidirected edge.
assert G.has_edge("X", "Y", edge_type="directed")
G.add_edge("Z", "Y", edge_type="bidirected")
assert not G.has_edge("Z", "Y", edge_type="directed")

# Now, we can remove the Z <-> Y bidirected edge.
G.remove_edge("Z", "Y", edge_type="bidirected")

# %%
# Mixed Edge Graph Key Differences
# --------------------------------
# Mixed edge graphs implement the standard networkx API, but the
# ``adj``, ``edges``, and ``degree`` are functions instead of
# class properties. Moreover, one can specify the edge type.

# Neighbors: Compared to its uni-edge networkx counterparts, a mixed-edge
# graph has many edge types. We define neighbors as any node with a connection.
# This is similar to `nx.Graph` where neighbors are any adjacent neighbors.
assert "Z" in G.neighbors("X")

# Similar to the networkx API, the ``adj`` provides a way to iterate
# through the nodes and edges, but now over different edge types.
for edge_type, adj in G.adj.items():
    print(edge_type)
    print(adj)

# If you only want the adjacencies of the directed edges, you can
# query the returned dictionary of adjacencies.
print(G.adj["directed"])

# Similar to the networkx API, the ``edges`` provides a way to iterate
# through the edges, but now over different edge types.
for edge_type, edges in G.edges().items():
    print(edge_type)
    print(edges)

# Similar to the networkx API, the ``edges`` provides a way to iterate
# through the edges, but now over different edge types.
for node, degrees in G.degree().items():
    print(f"{node} with degree: {degrees}")
