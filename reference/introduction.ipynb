    "The structure of NetworkX can be seen by the organization of its source code.\n",

    "Most of the NetworkX API is provided by functions which take a graph object\n",

    "and reporting.  This provides modularity of code and documentation.\n",

    "The source code for each module is meant to be easy to read and reading\n",
    "this Python code is actually a good way to learn more about network algorithms,\n",
