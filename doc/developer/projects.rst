Mentored Projects
==================

This page maintains a list of mentored project ideas that contributors can work
on if they are interested in contributing to the NetworkX project. Feel free to
suggest any other idea if you are interested on the
`NetworkX GitHub discussions page <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions>`__

These ideas can be used as projects for Google Summer of Code, Outreachy,
NumFOCUS Small Development Grants and university course/project credits (if
your university allows contribution to open source for credit).


Pedagogical Interactive Notebooks for Algorithms Implemented in NetworkX
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Abstract: NetworkX has a :ref:`wide variety of algorithms <Algorithms>`
  implemented. Even though the algorithms are well documented, explanations of
  the ideas behind the algorithms are often missing and we would like to
  collect these, write Jupyter notebooks to elucidate these ideas and explore
  the algorithms experimentally, and publish the notebooks at
  https://github.com/networkx/notebooks. The goal is to gives readers a
  deeper outlook behind standard network science and graph theory algorithms
  and encourage them to delve further into the topic.

- Recommended Skills: Python, Jupyter notebooks, graph algorithms.

- Expected Outcome: A collection of Interactive Jupyter notebooks which
  explain and explore network algorithms to readers and users of NetworkX.
  For example, see this notebook on
  :doc:`Random Geometric Graphs <content/generators/geometric>`

- Complexity: Depending on the algorithms you are interested to work on.

- Interested Mentors: `@dschult <https://github.com/dschult/>`__,
  `@MridulS <https://github.com/MridulS/>`__,
  `@rossbar <https://github.com/rossbar/>`__
  
- Expected time commitment: This project can be either a medium project (~175 hours)
  or a large project (~350 hours). The contributor is expected to contribute 2-3
  pedagogical interactive notebooks for the medium duration project and 4-5 notebooks
  for the long duration project.
