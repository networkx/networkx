Mentored Projects
==================

This page maintains a list of mentored project ideas that contributors can work
on if they are interested in contributing to the NetworkX project. Feel free to
suggest any other idea if you are interested on the
`NetworkX GitHub discussions page <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions>`__

These ideas can be used as projects for Google Summer of Code, Outreachy,
NumFOCUS Small Development Grants and university course/project credits (if
your university allows contribution to open source for credit). Mentee/contributors
participating under NetworkX organisation would be expected to share their weekly
work updates and get feedback in a 1-hr weekly meetings. If this isn't feasible for
the contributor we can discuss further to figure something else out.

If you are a professor interested in having your class develop tools
and contribute the results to NetworkX, we welcome your submissions!
We encourage you to consider rewriting/improving existing functions
as a potential source of projects. Working off of and
improving existing tools involves reading, evaluating and writing code,
rather than just writing new code. We also encourage them to review each
other's PRs. You can have students submit their PRs to your personal fork,
discuss, review, etc in an environment conducive to mentoring and learning.
Once their branch is ready to merge, it can be submitted to the main NetworkX
repository. This will help keep in-class discussions separate from the
broader NetworkX review process, making both more manageable and readable.
Feel free to reach out to use as you plan these activities.

Creating a cookie-cutter backend repository in NetworkX
-------------------------------------------------------

- Abstract: NetworkX has recently incorporated a backend `plugin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)>`__
  system based on `Python entry-points <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/>`__.
  This project aims to develop a template backend repository to help developers
  create their own NetworkX backends with ease. The template will clearly distinguish
  between the mandatory, optional, and additional features/requirements that a NetworkX
  backend package needs to have. We expect this template backend to be forked by the
  developers, and then they would only have to add their backend implementation for the
  algorithms they want to support at the designated places, and they would not have to
  care about setting up all the other aspects of a backend unless they want to enable
  or adopt any of the optional or additional functionalities of a backend. You can start by:
    - looking at `nx-j4f <https://github.com/Schefflera-Arboricola/nx-j4f>`__ (a dummy backend)
      and `nx-parallel <https://github.com/networkx/nx-parallel>`__ (a simple backend) for inspiration.
    - reading and understanding `Backends <https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/reference/backends.html>`__
      and `Configs <https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/reference/configs.html>`__ documentation.
  Feel free to ask questions or open an issue if you find something hard to understand,
  as the above documentations are not that well-written.

- Recommended Skills: Python, willingness to roll up your sleeves and dig deep
  and understand the dispatching mechanism in NetworkX, and ability to take feedback
  and iterate on your work.

- Expected Outcome: A "ready-to-fork" and comprehensive backend template in the
  NetworkX organization.

- Expected time commitment: ~350 hours project

- Complexity: Medium

- Interested Mentors: `@Schefflera-Arboricola <https://github.com/Schefflera-Arboricola>`__,
  `@dschult <https://github.com/dschult/>`__

Adding embarrassingly parallel graph algorithms in nx-parallel
--------------------------------------------------------------

- Abstract: `nx-parallel <https://github.com/networkx/nx-parallel>`__ is a NetworkX
  backend that uses `joblib <https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__ for
  implementing parallel graph algorithms. Currently, only some of the NetworkX
  `algorithms are implemented in nx-parallel <https://github.com/networkx/nx-parallel?tab=readme-ov-file#algorithms-in-nx-parallel>`__.
  We expect the contributor to find `embarrassingly parallel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel>`__
  graph algorithms from the :ref:`wide variety of graph algorithms <Algorithms>`
  implemented in NetworkX and then write their parallel implementations in nx-parallel.
  You can start by looking at:
    - the implementations of existing algorithms in nx-parallel for inspiration.
    - Joblib docs: `Embarrassingly parallel for loops <https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parallel.html>`__
  Find more details in `Issue#82 <https://github.com/networkx/nx-parallel/issues/82>`__.

- Recommended Skills: Python, willingness to roll up your sleeves and dig deep
  and understand nx-parallel's infrastructure, and ability to take feedback and
  iterate on your work.

- Expected Outcome: 3 parallel graph algorithms (~175 hours), or 7 (~350 hours),
  implemented in nx-parallel.

- Complexity: Medium

- Interested Mentors: `@Schefflera-Arboricola <https://github.com/Schefflera-Arboricola>`__,
  `@dschult <https://github.com/dschult/>`__

Pedagogical Interactive Notebooks for Algorithms Implemented in NetworkX
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Abstract: NetworkX has a :ref:`wide variety of algorithms <Algorithms>`
  implemented. Even though the algorithms are well documented, explanations of
  the ideas behind the algorithms are often missing and we would like to
  collect these, write Jupyter notebooks to elucidate these ideas and explore
  the algorithms experimentally, and publish the notebooks at
  https://github.com/networkx/notebooks. The goal is to gives readers a
  deeper outlook behind standard network science and graph theory algorithms
  and encourage them to delve further into the topic.

- Recommended Skills: Python, Jupyter notebooks, graph algorithms.

- Expected Outcome: A collection of Interactive Jupyter notebooks which
  explain and explore network algorithms to readers and users of NetworkX.
  For example, see this notebook on
  :doc:`Geometric Generator Models <nx-guides:content/generators/geometric>`

- Complexity: Depending on the algorithms you are interested to work on.

- Interested Mentors: `@MridulS <https://github.com/MridulS/>`__,
  `@rossbar <https://github.com/rossbar/>`__,
  `@Schefflera-Arboricola <https://github.com/Schefflera-Arboricola>`__

- Expected time commitment: This project can be either a medium project (~175 hours)
  or a large project (~350 hours). The contributor is expected to contribute 2-3
  pedagogical interactive notebooks for the medium duration project and 4-5 notebooks
  for the long duration project.

Incorporate a Python library for ISMAGs isomorphism calculations
----------------------------------------------------------------

- Abstract: A team from Sandia Labs has converted the original java implementation of
  the ISMAGS isomorphism routines to Python. They have invited us to incorporate that
  code into NetworkX if we are interested. We'd like someone to learn the ISMAGS code
  we currently provide, and the code from this new library and figure out what the
  best combination is to include in NetworkX moving forward. That could be two separate
  subpackages of tools, or more likely a combination of the two sets of code, or a
  third incantation that combines good features from each.

- Recommended Skills: Python, graph algorithms.

- Expected Outcome: A plan for how to best incorporate ISMAGS into NetworkX along
  with code to do that incorporation.

- Interested Mentors: `@dschult <https://github.com/dschult/>`__,
  `@rossbar <https://github.com/rossbar/>`__

- Expected time commitment: This project will be a full time 10 week project (~350 hrs).

Centrality Atlas
----------------

- Abstract: The goal of this project would be to produce a comprehensive review
  of network centrality measures.
  Centrality is a central concept in network science and has many applications
  across domains. NetworkX provides many functions for measuring
  various types of :doc:`network centrality</reference/algorithms/centrality>`.
  The individual centrality functions are typically well-described by their
  docstrings (though there's always room for improvement!); however, there
  currently is no big-picture overview of centrality.
  Furthermore, many of the centrality measures are closely related, but there is
  no documentation that describes these relationships.

- Recommended Skills: Python, literature review, technical writing

- Expected Outcome: An executable document that provides an overview and applications
  of network centrality measures. Potential outputs include (but are not limited
  to): an article for ``nx-guides`` (see above) and/or an example gallery for centrality
  measures.

- Interested Mentors: `@dschult <https://github.com/dschult/>`__,
  `@rossbar <https://github.com/rossbar/>`__,
  `@Schefflera-Arboricola <https://github.com/Schefflera-Arboricola>`__

- Expected time commitment: Variable, though a high-quality review article would
  be expected to take several months of dedicated research (~350 hours).
