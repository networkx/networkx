Mentored Projects
==================

This page maintains a list of mentored project ideas that contributors can work
on if they are interested in contributing to the NetworkX project. Feel free to
suggest any other idea if you are interested on the
`NetworkX GitHub discussions page <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/discussions>`__ 

These ideas can be used as projects for Google Summer of Code, Outreachy,
NumFOCUS Small Development Grants and university course/project credits (if
your university allows contribution to open source for credit).


Community Detection Algorithms
--------------------------------

- Abstract: Community detection is a set of algorithms in network science which
  deals with grouping nodes in a network according to related properties or
  dense clusters. NetworkX already contains a
  :mod:`variety of algorithms <networkx.algorithms.community>`
  dealing with computing the community structure of a network. There are
  multiple PRs/issues which deals with adding the Louvain algorithm to
  NetworkX, e.g. `#1090`_, `#1092`_ `#951`_. Users who want to work with
  NetworkX and Louvain Community Detection usually use
  https://github.com/taynaud/python-louvain.

- Recommended Skills: Python, graph algorithms

- Expected Outcome: We would like to see Louvain community detection natively
  implemented inside NetworkX, or interfaced with other projects with
  documentated examples. 

- Complexity: Moderate

.. _#951: https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/951


Pedagogical Interactive Notebooks for Algorithms Implemented in NetworkX
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Abstract: NetworkX has a :ref:`wide variety of algorithms <Algorithms>`
  impelemented. Even though the algorithms well documented, the explainations
  behind the algorithms are missing and we would like to collect these
  notebooks and host them at https://github.com/networkx/notebooks which gives
  users a deeper outlook behind standard network science and graph theory
  algorithms if they would like to delve further into the topic.

- Recommended Skills: Python, Jupyter notebooks, graph algorithms.

- Expected Outcome: A collection of Interactive Jupyter notebooks which
  explains the algorithm to readers and users of NetworkX. An example notebook
  about Random Geometric Graphs is available at
  https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/networkx/notebooks/blob/master/generators/geometric.ipynb

- Complexity: Depending on the algorithms you are interested to work on.
