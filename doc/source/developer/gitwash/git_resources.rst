Tutorials and summaries
=======================

`github help`_ is Git's own help and tutorial site. `github more help`_
lists more resources for learning Git and GitHub, including YouTube
channels.  The list is constantly updated.  In case you are used to subversion_
, you can directly consult the `git svn crash course`_.

To make full use of Git, you need to understand the concept behind Git.
The following pages might help you:

* `git parable`_ |emdash| an easy read parable
* `git foundation`_ |emdash| more on the git parable
* `git magic`_ |emdash| extended introduction with intermediate detail in many languages
* `git concepts`_ |emdash| a technical page on the concepts

Other than that, many devlopers list their personal tips and tricks.
Among others there are `Fernando Perez`_, `Nick Quaranto`_ and `Linus Torvalds`_.

Manual pages online
===================

You can get these on your own machine with (e.g) ``git help push`` or
(same thing) ``git push --help``, but, for convenience, here are the
online manual pages for some common commands:

* `git add`_
* `git branch`_
* `git checkout`_
* `git clone`_
* `git commit`_
* `git config`_
* `git diff`_
* `git log`_
* `git pull`_
* `git push`_
* `git remote`_
