Requires
========

NetworkX uses the Python `nose` testing package.  If you don't already have
that package installed, follow the directions on the `nose homepage`_.

.. _nose homepage: https://nose.readthedocs.org/

Test a source distribution
==========================

You can test the complete package from the unpacked source directory with::

    nosetests networkx -v


Test an installed package
=========================

If you have a file-based (not a Python egg) installation you can test the
installed package with::

    >>> import networkx
    >>> networkx.test()

or::

    python -c "import networkx; networkx.test()"

Testing for developers
======================

You can test any or all of NetworkX by using the `nosetests` test runner.

First make sure the NetworkX version you want to test is in your `PYTHONPATH`
(either installed or pointing to your unpacked source directory).

Then you can run individual test files with::

    nosetests path/to/file

or all tests found in dir and an directories contained in dir::

    nosetests path/to/dir

By default nosetests does not test docutils style tests in
Python modules but you can turn that on with::

    nosetests --with-doctest

For doctests in stand-alone files NetworkX uses the extension `txt` so
you can add::

    nosetests --with-doctest --doctest-extension=txt

to also execute those tests.

These options are on by default if you run nosetests from the root of the
NetworkX distribution since they are specified in the `setup.cfg` file found
there.
