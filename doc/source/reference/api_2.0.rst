New functionalities
-------------------

* [`#823 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/823>`_]
  A ``enumerate_all_cliques`` function is added in the clique package
  (``networkx.algorithms.clique``) for enumerating all cliques (including
  nonmaximal ones) of undirected graphs.

* [`#1105 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1105>`_]
  A coloring package (``networkx.algorithms.coloring``) is created for
  graph coloring algorithms. Initially, a ``greedy_color`` function is
  provided for coloring graphs using various greedy heuristics.

* [`#1193 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1193>`_]
  A new generator ``edge_dfs``, added to ``networkx.algorithms.traversal``,
  implements a depth-first traversal of the edges in a graph. This complements
  functionality provided by a depth-first traversal of the nodes in a graph.
  For multigraphs, it allows the user to know precisely which edges were
  followed in a traversal. All NetworkX graph types are supported. A traversal
  can also reverse edge orientations or ignore them.

* [`#1194 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1194>`_]
  A ``find_cycle`` function is added to the ``networkx.algorithms.cycles``
  package to find a cycle in a graph. Edge orientations can be optionally
  reversed or ignored.

* [`#1210 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1210>`_]
  Add a random generator for the duplication-divergence model.

* [`#1241 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1241>`_]
  A new ``networkx.algorithms.dominance`` package is added for
  dominance/dominator algorithms on directed graphs. It contains a
  ``immediate_dominators`` function for computing immediate
  dominators/dominator trees and a ``dominance_frontiers`` function for
  computing dominance frontiers.

* [`#1269 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1269>`_]
  The GML reader/parser and writer/generator are rewritten to remove the
  dependence on pyparsing and enable handling of arbitrary graph data.

* [`#1280 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1280>`_]
  The network simplex method in the ``networkx.algorithms.flow`` package is
  rewritten to improve its performance and support multi- and disconnected
  networks. For some cases, the new implementation is two or three orders of
  magnitude faster than the old implementation.

* [`#1286 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1286>`_]
  Added the Margulis--Gabber--Galil graph to ``networkx.generators``.

* [`#1306 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1306>`_]
  Added the chordal p-cycle graph, a mildly explicit algebraic construction
  of a family of 3-regular expander graphs. Also, moves both the existing
  expander graph generator function (for the Margulis-Gabber-Galil
  expander) and the new chordal cycle graph function to a new module,
  ``networkx.generators.expanders``.

* [`#1314 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1314>`_]
  Allow overwriting of base class dict with dict-like:
  OrderedGraph, ThinGraph, LogGraph, etc.

* [`#1321 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1321>`_]
  Added ``to_pandas_dataframe`` and ``from_pandas_dataframe``

* [`#1322 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1322>`_]
  Added the Hopcroft--Karp algorithm for finding a maximum cardinality
  matching in bipartite graphs.

* [`#1336 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1336>`_]
  Expanded data keyword in G.edges and added default keyword

* [`#1338 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1338>`_]
  Added support for finding optimum branchings and arborescences.

* [`#1356 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1356>`_]
  Added ordered variants of default graph class.

* [`#1360 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1360>`_]
  Added harmonic centrality to ``network.algorithms.centrality``.

* [`#1390 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1390>`_]
  The ``generators.bipartite`` have been moved to
  ``algorithms.bipartite.generators``. The functions are not imported in the
  main  namespace, so to use it, the bipartite package has to be imported.

* [`#1405 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1405>`_]
  Added fast approximation for node connectivity based on White and
  Newman's approximation algorithm for finding node independent paths
  between two nodes.

* [`#1413 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1413>`_]
  Added transitive closure and antichains function for directed acyclic
  graphs in ``algorithms.dag``

* [`#1425 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1425>`_]
  Added generator function for the complete multipartite graph.

* [`#1427 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1427>`_]
  Added nonisomorphic trees generator

* [`#1436 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1436>`_]
  Added a generator function for circulant graphs to the
  ``networkx.generators.classic`` module.

* [`#1437 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1437>`_]
  Added function for computing quotient graphs; also created a new module,
  ``networkx.algorithms.minors``.

* [`#1445 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1448>`_]
  Added a new modularity matrix module to ``networkx.linalg``,
  and associated spectrum functions to the ``networkx.linalg.spectrum``
  module.

* [`#1455 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1455>`_]
  Added the directed modularity matrix to the
  ``networkx.linalg.modularity_matrix`` module.

* [`#1447 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1447>`_]
  Added function to generate all simple paths starting with the shortest
  ones based on Yen's algorithm for finding k shortest paths at
  ``algorithms.simple_paths``

* [`#1474 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1474>`_]
  Adds ``triadic_census`` function; also creates a new module,
  :mod:`networkx.algorithms.triads`.

* [`#1438 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1438>`_]
  Added longest_path and longest_path_length for DAG

Removed functionalities
-----------------------

* [`#1236 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1236>`_]
  The legacy ``ford_fulkerson`` maximum flow function is removed. Use
  ``edmonds_karp`` instead.

Miscellaneous changes
---------------------

* [`#1192 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1192>`_]
  Support for Python 2.6 is dropped.
