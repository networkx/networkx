API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~
Returning dictionaries
**********************
Several of the algorithms and the degree() method now return dictionaries
keyed by node instead of lists.  In some cases there was a with_labels
keyword which is no longer necessary.  For example,

>>> G=nx.Graph()
>>> G.add_edge('a','b')
>>> G.degree()  # doctest: +SKIP
{'a': 1, 'b': 1}

Asking for the degree of a single node still returns a single number

>>> G.degree('a')
1

The following now return dictionaries by default (instead of lists)
and the with_labels keyword has been removed:

 - :meth:`Graph.degree`,
   :meth:`MultiGraph.degree`,
   :meth:`DiGraph.degree`,
   :meth:`DiGraph.in_degree`,
   :meth:`DiGraph.out_degree`,
   :meth:`MultiDiGraph.degree`,
   :meth:`MultiDiGraph.in_degree`,
   :meth:`MultiDiGraph.out_degree`.
 - :func:`clustering`,
   :func:`triangles`
 - :func:`node_clique_number`,
   :func:`number_of_cliques`,
   :func:`cliques_containing_node`
 - :func:`eccentricity`


The following now return dictionaries by default (instead of lists)

 - :func:`pagerank`
 - :func:`hits`


Adding nodes
************
``add_nodes_from`` now accepts ``(node, attrdict)`` two-tuples

>>> G = nx.Graph()
>>> G.add_nodes_from([(1, {'color': 'red'})])

Examples
~~~~~~~~
 - `Mayvi2 drawing <https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/auto_examples/3d_drawing/mayavi2_spring.html>`_
 - `Blockmodel <https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/auto_examples/algorithms/plot_blockmodel.html>`_
 - `Sampson's monastery <https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/auto_examples/drawing/plot_sampson.html>`_
 - `Ego graph <https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/auto_examples/drawing/plot_ego_graph.html>`_

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
 - Support graph attributes with union, intersection, and other graph operations
 - Improve subgraph speed (and related algorithms such as
   connected_components_subgraphs())
 - Handle multigraphs in more operators (e.g. union)
 - Handle double-quoted labels with pydot
 - Normalize betweenness_centrality for undirected graphs correctly
 - Normalize eigenvector_centrality by l2 norm
 - :func:`read_gml` now returns multigraphs

https://networkx.lanl.gov/trac/ - bug tracking and info


Important Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The naming conventions in NetworkX have changed.
The package name "NX" is now "networkx".

The suggested ways to import the NetworkX package are

 - import networkx
 - import networkx as NX
 - from networkx import *

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - DiGraph reverse
  - Graph generators
     + watts_strogatz_graph now does rewiring method

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
   - Fixed logic in io.py for reading DiGraphs.
   - Path based centrality measures (betweenness, closeness)
     modified so they work on graphs that are not connected and
     produce the same result as if each connected component were
     considered separately.
