API changes
-----------
* Base Graph Class Changes
  With the release of NetworkX 2.0 we are moving towards an iterator reporting API.
  We used to have two methods for the same property of the graph, one that returns a
  list and one that returns an iterator. With 2.0 we have removed the one that returns
  a list and renamed the iterator returning method as the original one. For example,
  ``G.nodes()`` used to return a list and ``G.nodes_iter()`` used to return an iterator, now
  ``G.nodes()`` returns an iterator and ``G.nodes_iter()`` is removed. Routines that used to
  return a dict now return an iterator of (key,value) 2-tuples, so that dict(G.degree())
  returns a dict keyed by node with degree as value.
  The old behavior

    >>> G = nx.complete_graph(5)
    >>> G.nodes()
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> G.nodes_iter()
    <dictionary-keyiterator at 0x10898f470>

  has changed to

    >>> G = nx.complete_graph(5)
    >>> G.nodes()
    <dictionary-keyiterator at 0x10898f470>
    >>> list(G.nodes())
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]


  The following methods have changed:
    * Graph/MultiGraph

      * ``G.nodes()``
      * ``G.edges()``
      * ``G.neighbors()``
      * ``G.adjacency_list()`` and ``G.adjacency_iter()`` to ``G.adjacency()``
      * ``G.degree()``
      * ``G.nodes_with_selfloops()``
      * ``G.selfloop_edges()``

    * DiGraph/MultiDiGraph

      * ``G.nodes()``
      * ``G.edges()``
      * ``G.in_edges()``
      * ``G.out_edges()``
      * ``G.degree()``
      * ``G.in_degree()``
      * ``G.out_degree()``

  Many subclasses have been changed accordingly such as:
    * AntiGraph
    * OrderedGraph and friends
    * Examples such as ThinGraph that inherit from Graph

* [`#1577 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/1577>`_]
  In addition to minimum spanning trees, a new function for calculating maximum
  spanning trees is now provided. The new API consists of four functions:
  ``minimum_spanning_edges``, ``maximum_spanning_edges``,
  ``minimum_spanning_tree``, and ``maximum_spanning_tree``.
  All of these functions accept an ``algorithm`` parameter which specifies the
  algorithm to use when finding the minimum or maximum spanning tree. Currently,
  Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms are implemented, defined as 'kruskal' and
  'prim', respectively. If nothing is specified, Kruskal's algorithm is used.
  For example, to calculate the maximum spanning tree of a graph using Kruskal's
  algorithm, the function ``maximum_spanning_tree`` has to be called like::

      >>> nx.maximum_spanning_tree(G, algorithm='kruskal')

  The ``algorithm`` parameter is new and appears before the existing ``weight``
  parameter. So existing code that did not explicitly name the optional
  ``weight`` parameter will need to be updated::

      >>> nx.minimum_spanning_tree(G, 'mass')  # old
      >>> nx.minimum_spanning_tree(G, weight='mass') # new

  In the above, we are still relying on the the functions being imported into the
  top-level  namespace. We do not have immediate plans to deprecate this approach,
  but we recommend the following instead::

       >>> from networkx.algorithms import tree
       # recommended
       >>> tree.minimum_spanning_tree(G, algorithm='kruskal', weight='mass')
       >>> tree.minimum_spanning_edges(G, algorithm='prim', weight='mass')
