Migration guide from 1.X to 2.0
*******************************

This is a guide for people moving from NetworkX 1.X to NetworkX 2.0

Any issues with these can be discussed on the `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/networkx-discuss>`_.

As you know we have made some major changes to the methods in the Multi/Di/Graph classes.
Methods that used to return containers now return iterators and methods that returned iterators have been removed.
For example, ``G.nodes()`` now returns an iterator and ``G.nodes_iter()`` has been removed.

The methods changed are explained with examples below.

	>>> import networkx as nx
	>>> G = nx.complete_graph(5) 
	>>> G.nodes()
        NodeView((0, 1, 2, 3, 4))

People suprised by this output and expecting something like this

	>>> G.nodes()  # doctest: +SKIP
	[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

don't panic. Nothing is wrong.

Now ``G.nodes()`` returns an iterator. If you want a list of nodes send the iterator to the Python list function

	>>> list(G.nodes())
	[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

In the same way for ``G.edges()``

	>>> G.edges()
        EdgeView([(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)])
	>>> list(G.edges())
        [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)]

and ``G.neighbors(n)`` where n is a node.
 
	>>> G.neighbors(2)
	<dictionary-keyiterator object at ...>

	>>> list(G.neighbors(2))
	[0, 1, 3, 4]

So, basically you can switch back to the old behavior by adding `list()` to the method.

For methods that used to return a dict, like ``G.degree()``, the new iterator version
returns a (key,value) 2-tuple so that passing it to Python's dict function recovers
the original behavior if desired.
Note that passing a single node to the degree method still returns the degree of that node as it always has.

	>>> G.degree(2)
	4
	>>> G.degree([1,2,3])
        DegreeView({1: 4, 2: 4, 3: 4})
	>>> list(G.degree([1,2,3]))
	[(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)]
	>>> dict(G.degree([1,2,3]))
	{1: 4, 2: 4, 3: 4}
	>>> G.degree()
        DegreeView({0: 4, 1: 4, 2: 4, 3: 4, 4: 4})
	>>> list(G.degree())
	[(0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)]
	>>> dict(G.degree())
	{0: 4, 1: 4, 2: 4, 3: 4, 4: 4}

``G.degree()`` used to return a dictionary. We can typecast the generator to return a list or dict as shown in the
above example.

Now lets move to DiGraphs. Everything is similar to Graphs. But we have a few more methods for DiGraphs.
Let's have a look on them.

	>>> D = nx.DiGraph()
	>>> D.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3), (2, 4)])
	>>> D.nodes()
        NodeView((1, 2, 3, 4))
	>>> list(D.nodes())
	[1, 2, 3, 4]
	>>> D.edges()
        OutEdgeView([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)])
	>>> list(D.edges())
	[(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)] 
	>>> D.in_degree(2)
	1
	>>> D.out_degree(2)
	2
	>>> D.in_edges()
        InEdgeView([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)])
	>>> list(D.in_edges())
	[(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)]
	>>> D.out_edges(2)
        OutEdgeDataView([(2, 3), (2, 4)])
	>>> list(D.out_edges(2))
        [(2, 3), (2, 4)]
	>>> D.in_degree()
        InDegreeView({1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 1})
	>>> list(D.in_degree())
	[(1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1)]
	>>> D.successors(2)
        <dictionary-keyiterator object at ...>
	>>> list(D.successors(2))
	[3, 4]
	>>> D.predecessors(2)
        <dictionary-keyiterator object at ...>
	>>> list(D.predecessors(2))
	[1]

The same changes apply to MultiGraphs and MultiDiGraphs.

 
-------

The order of arguments to ``set_edge_attributes`` and ``set_node_attributes`` has
changed.  The position of ``name`` and ``values`` has been swapped, and ``name`` now
defaults to ``None``.  The previous call signature of ``(graph, name, value)`` has
been changed to ``(graph, value, name=None)``. The new style allows for ``name`` to
be ommitted in favor of passing a dictionary of dictionaries to ``values``.

A simple method for migrating existing code to the new version is to explicitly
specify the keyword argument names. This method is backwards compatible and
ensures the correct arguments are passed, regardless of the order. For example the old code

    >>> G = nx.Graph([(1, 2), (1, 3)])
    >>> nx.set_node_attributes(G, 'label', {1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'})
    >>> nx.set_edge_attributes(G, 'label', {(1, 2): 'path1', (2, 3): 'path2'})

Will cause ``TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'`` in the new version. The code
can be refactored as

    >>> G = nx.Graph([(1, 2), (1, 3)])
    >>> nx.set_node_attributes(G, name='label', values={1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'})
    >>> nx.set_edge_attributes(G, name='label', values={(1, 2): 'path1', (2, 3): 'path2'})
