API Changes
-----------

- [`#4183 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4183>`_]
  ``partition`` argument of `quotient_graph` now accepts dicts
- [`#4190 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4190>`_]
  Removed ``tracemin_chol``.  Use ``tracemin_lu`` instead.
- [`#4216 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4216>`_]
  In `to_*_array/matrix`, nodes in nodelist but not in G now raise an exception.
  Use G.add_nodes_from(nodelist) to add them to G before converting.
- [`#4360  <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4360>`_]
  Internally `.nx_pylab.draw_networkx_edges` now always generates a
  list of `matplotlib.patches.FancyArrowPatch` rather than using
  a `matplotlib.collections.LineCollection` for un-directed graphs.  This
  unifies interface for all types of graphs.  In
  addition to the API change this may cause a performance regression for
  large graphs.
- [`#4384 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4384>`_]
  Added ``edge_key`` parameter for MultiGraphs in to_pandas_edgelist
- [`#4461 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4461>`_]
  Added ``create_using`` parameter to ``binomial_tree``
- [`#4466 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4466>`_]
  `relabel_nodes` used to raise a KeyError for a key in `mapping` that is not
  a node in the graph, but it only did this when `copy` was `False`. Now
  any keys in `mapping` which are not in the graph are ignored.
- [`#4502 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4502>`_]
  Moves ``maximum_independent_set`` to the ``clique`` module in ``approximation``.
- [`#4536 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4536>`_]
  Deprecate ``performance`` and ``coverage`` in favor of ``partition_quality``,
  which computes both metrics simultaneously and is more efficient.
- [`#4573 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4573>`_]
  `label_propagation_communities` returns a `dict_values` object of community
  sets of nodes instead of a generator of community sets. It is still iterable,
  so likely will still work in most user code and a simple fix otherwise:
  e.g., add ``iter( ... )`` surrounding the function call.
- [`#4545 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4545>`_]
  `prefix_tree` used to return `tree, root` but root is now always 0
  instead of a UUID generate string. So the function returns `tree`.
- [`#4545 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4545>`_]
  The variable `NIL` ="NIL" has been removed from `networkx.generators.trees`
- [`#3620 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/3620>`_]
  The function `naive_greedy_modularity_communities` now returns a
  list of communities (like `greedy_modularity_communities`) instead
  of a generator of communities.
- [`#4786 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4786>`_]
  Deprecate the ``attrs`` keyword argument in favor of explicit keyword
  arguments in the ``json_graph`` module.
- [`#4843 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4843>`_]
  The unused ``normalized`` parameter has been removed
  from ``communicability_betweeness_centrality``
- [`#4850 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4850>`_]
  Added ``dtype`` parameter to adjacency_matrix
- [`#4867 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/4867>`_]
  The function ``spring_layout`` now ignores 'fixed' nodes not in the graph
