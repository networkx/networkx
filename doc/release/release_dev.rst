Highlights
----------

This release is the result of X of work with over X pull requests by
X contributors. Highlights include:

.. warning::
   Hash values observed in outputs of 
   `~networkx.algorithms.graph_hashing.weisfeiler_lehman_graph_hash`
   have changed in version 2.7 due to bug fixes. See gh-4946_ for details.
   This means that comparing hashes of the same graph computed with different
   versions of NetworkX (i.e. before and after version 2.7)
   could wrongly fail an isomorphism test (isomorphic graphs always have matching
   Weisfeiler-Lehman hashes). Users are advised to recalculate any stored graph
   hashes they may have on upgrading.
