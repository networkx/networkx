NetworkX 3.0 (unreleased)
=========================

Release date: TBD

Supports Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.

NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the
structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

For more information, please visit our `website <https://networkx.org/>`_
and our :ref:`gallery of examples <examples_gallery>`.
Please send comments and questions to the `networkx-discuss mailing list
<http://groups.google.com/group/networkx-discuss>`_.

Highlights
----------

This release is the result of 8 months of work with over 217 pull requests by
37 contributors. We also have a `guide for people moving from NetworkX 2.X
to NetworkX 3.0 <https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/release/migration_guide_from_2.x_to_3.0.html>`. Highlights include:

- Better syncing between G._succ and G._adj for directed G.
  And slightly better speed from all the core adjacency data structures.
  G.adj is now a cached_property while still having the cache reset when
  G._adj is set to a new dict (which doesn't happen very often).
  Note: We have always assumed that G._succ and G._adj point to the same
  object. But we did not enforce it well. If you have somehow worked
  around our attempts and are relying on these private attributes being
  allowed to be different from each other due to loopholes in our previous
  code, you will have to look for other loopholes in our new code
  (or subclass DiGraph to explicitly allow this).
- If your code sets G._succ or G._adj to new dictionary-like objects, you no longer
  have to set them both. Setting either will ensure the other is set as well.
  And the cached_properties G.adj and G.succ will be rest accordingly too.
- If you use the presence of the attribute `_adj` as a criteria for the object
  being a Graph instance, that code may need updating. The graph classes
  themselves now have an attribute `_adj`. So, it is possible that whatever you
  are checking might be a class rather than an instance. We suggest you check
  for attribute `_adj` to verify it is like a NetworkX graph object or type and
  then `type(obj) is type` to check if it is a class.
- We have added an experimental plugin feature which let users choose alternate
  backends like GraphBLAS, CuGraph for computation. This is an opt-in feature and
  may change in future releases.
- Improved integration with the general `Scientific Python ecosystem <https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/release/migration_guide_from_2.x_to_3.0.html#improved-integration-with-scientific-python>`

Improvements
------------
- [`#5663 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5663>`_]
  Implements edge swapping for directed graphs.
- [`#5883 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5883>`_]
  Replace the implementation of ``lowest_common_ancestor`` and
  ``all_pairs_lowest_common_ancestor`` with a "naive" algorithm to fix
  several bugs and improve performance.
- [`#5912 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5912>`_]
  The ``mapping`` argument of the ``relabel_nodes`` function can be either a
  mapping or a function that creates a mapping. ``relabel_nodes`` first checks
  whether the ``mapping`` is callable - if so, then it is used as a function.
  This fixes a bug related for ``mapping=str`` and may change the behavior for
  other ``mapping`` arguments that implement both ``__getitem__`` and
  ``__call__``.
- [`#5898 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5898>`_]
  Implements computing and checking for minimal d-separators between two nodes.
  Also adds functionality to DAGs for computing v-structures.
- [`#5943 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5943>`_]
  ``is_path`` used to raise a `KeyError` when the ``path`` argument contained
  a node that was not in the Graph. The behavior has been updated so that
  ``is_path`` returns `False` in this case rather than raising the exception.
- [`#6003 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/6003>`_]
  ``avg_shortest_path_length`` now raises an exception if the provided
  graph is directed but not strongly connected. The previous test (weak
  connecting) was wrong; in that case, the returned value was nonsensical.

API Changes
-----------

- [`#5899 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5899>`_]
  The `attrs` keyword argument will be replaced with keyword only arguments
  `source`, `target`, `name`, `key` and `link` for `json_graph/node_link` functions.

Deprecations
------------

- [`#5723 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/5723>`_]
  ``nx.nx_pydot.*`` will be deprecated in the future if pydot isn't being
  actively maintained. Users are recommended to use pygraphviz instead. 
- [`#5899 <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5899>`_]
  The `attrs` keyword argument will be replaced with keyword only arguments
  `source`, `target`, `name`, `key` and `link` for `json_graph/node_link` functions.
