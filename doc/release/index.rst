Releases
********

We don't use semantic versioning.  The first number indicates that we have
made a major API break (e.g., 1.x to 2.x), which happens rarely.
The point releases are new versions and may contain minor API breakage.
Usually, this happens after a two cycle deprecation period.

.. warning::
   Since we don't normally make bug-fix only releases, it may not make sense
   for you to use ``~=`` as a pip version specifier.
