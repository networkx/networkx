NetworkX provides basic functionality for visualizing graphs, but its main goal
is to enable graph analysis rather than perform graph visualization. In the
future, graph visualization functionality may be removed from NetworkX or only
available as an add-on package.

Proper graph visualization is hard, and we highly recommend that people
visualize their graphs with tools dedicated to that task. Notable examples of
dedicated and fully-featured graph visualization tools are
`Cytoscape <http://www.cytoscape.org/>`_,
`Gephi <https://gephi.org/>`_,
`Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_ and, for
`LaTeX <http://www.latex-project.org/>`_ typesetting,
`PGF/TikZ <https://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/>`_.
To use these and other such tools, you should export your NetworkX graph into
a format that can be read by those tools. For example, Cytoscape can read the
GraphML format, and so, ``networkx.write_graphml(G)`` might be an appropriate
choice.
