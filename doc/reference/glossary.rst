   dictionary
      A Python dictionary maps keys to values. Also known as "hashes",
      or "associative arrays" in other programming languages.
      See :ref:`the Python tutorial on dictionaries <tut-dictionaries>`.

   edge
      Edges are either two-tuples of nodes `(u, v)` or three tuples of nodes
      with an edge attribute dictionary `(u, v, dict)`.

   ebunch
      An iteratable container of edge tuples like a list, iterator,
      or file.

   edge attribute
      Edges can have arbitrary Python objects assigned as attributes
      by using keyword/value pairs when adding an edge
      assigning to the `G.edges[u][v]` attribute dictionary for the
      specified edge *u*-*v*.

   nbunch
      An nbunch is a single node, container of nodes or `None` (representing
      all nodes). It can be a list, set, graph, etc.. To filter an nbunch
      so that only nodes actually in `G` appear, use `G.nbunch_iter(nbunch)`.

   node
      A node can be any hashable Python object except None.

   node attribute
     Nodes can have arbitrary Python objects assigned as attributes
     by using keyword/value pairs when adding a node or
     assigning to the `G.nodes[n]` attribute dictionary for the
     specified node `n`.
