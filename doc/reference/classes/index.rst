Graph types
***********

NetworkX provides data structures and methods for storing graphs.

All NetworkX graph classes allow (hashable) Python objects as nodes.
and any Python object can be assigned as an edge attribute. 

The choice of graph class depends on the structure of the 
graph you want to represent.   

Which graph class should I use?
