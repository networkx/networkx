Simple example
--------------

Find the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph:

.. code:: pycon

    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> G = nx.Graph()
    >>> G.add_edge("A", "B", weight=4)
    >>> G.add_edge("B", "D", weight=2)
    >>> G.add_edge("A", "C", weight=3)
    >>> G.add_edge("C", "D", weight=4)
    >>> nx.shortest_path(G, "A", "D", weight="weight")
    ['A', 'B', 'D']
