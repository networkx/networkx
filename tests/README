These files are for testing the methods and functions in NetworkX
The nose testing package is required for all tests:
http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose

The tests also demonstrate the usage of many of the features of NetworkX.

There are a few ways to run the tests. 

The simplest way is to import networkx and run the test() function.

>>> import networkx
>>> networkx.test()

or::

   python -c "import networkx; networkx.test()

If you have the source package and the nose testing package you
can test the complete package from the unpacked source directory with::

   python setup_egg.py nosetests

The python module benchmark.py can be used to compare relative speed of small
code bits using the timeit module for different graph classes.
