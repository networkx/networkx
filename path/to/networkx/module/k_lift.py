def k_lift(G, k):
    r"""Performs a k-lift of a d-regular graph using random permutations

    The resulting graph H has k copies of each node from G.
    For each edge (u, v) in G, a random permutation is used to connect the i-th copy of u
    to the permuted i-th copy of v in H.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx.Graph
        An undirected, connected, d-regular graph
    k : int
        The lift parameter. Each node in G is expanded to k copies.

    Returns
    -------
    H : networkx.Graph
        The resulting k-lifted graph.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the generated lifted graph is not connected.

    Notes
    -----
    Given a base graph G and a lift parameter k, this function performs a k-lift as follows:
    - For each node v in G, it creates k copies: (v, 0), ..., (v, k-1)
    - For each edge (u, v) in G, a random permutation σ is applied to determine new edges:
      if σ(i) = j, then ((u, i), (v, j)) is added to H.
      The permutation is simulated by creating a shuffled list `permutation` of values 0 to k-1.
      Each i-th copy of u is then connected to the `permutation[i]`-th copy of v.
