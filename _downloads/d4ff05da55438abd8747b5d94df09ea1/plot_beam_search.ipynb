This implementation simply returns the first node found that\n    matches the termination condition.\n\n    `G` is a NetworkX graph.\n\n    `source` is a node in the graph. The search for the node of interest\n    begins here and extends only to those nodes in the (weakly)\n    connected component of this node.\n\n    `value` is a function that returns a real number indicating how good\n    a potential neighbor node is when deciding which neighbor nodes to\n    enqueue in the breadth-first search. Only the best nodes within the\n    current beam width will be enqueued at each step.\n\n    `condition` is the termination condition for the search. This is a\n    function that takes a node as input and return a Boolean indicating\n    whether the node is the target. If no node matches the termination\n    condition, this function raises :exc:`NodeNotFound`.\n\n    `initial_width` is the starting beam width for the beam search (the\n    default is one). If no node matching the `condition` is found with\n    this beam width, the beam search is restarted from the `source` node\n    with a beam width that is twice as large (so the beam width\n    increases exponentially). The search terminates after the beam width\n    exceeds the number of nodes in the graph.\n\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check for the special case in which the source node satisfies the\n    # termination condition.\n    if condition(source):\n        return source\n    # The largest possible value of `i` in this range yields a width at\n    # least the number of nodes in the graph, so the final invocation of\n    # `bfs_beam_edges` is equivalent to a plain old breadth-first\n    # search. Therefore, all nodes will eventually be visited.\n    log_m = math.ceil(math.log2(len(G)))\n    for i in range(log_m):\n        width = initial_width * pow(2, i)\n        # Since we are always starting from the same source node, this\n        # search may visit the same nodes many times (depending on the\n        # implementation of the `value` function).\n        for u, v in nx.bfs_beam_edges(G, source, value, width):\n            if condition(v):\n                return v\n    # At this point, since all nodes have been visited, we know that\n    # none of the nodes satisfied the termination condition.\n    raise nx.NodeNotFound(\"no node satisfied the termination condition\")"
