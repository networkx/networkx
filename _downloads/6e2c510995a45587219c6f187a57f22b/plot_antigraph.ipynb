        "\n# Antigraph\n\nComplement graph class for small footprint when working on dense graphs.\n\nThis class allows you to add the edges that *do not exist* in the dense\ngraph. However, when applying algorithms to this complement graph data\nstructure, it behaves as if it were the dense version. So it can be used\ndirectly in several NetworkX algorithms.\n\nThis subclass has only been tested for k-core, connected_components,\nand biconnected_components algorithms but might also work for other\nalgorithms.\n"
