=======

NetworkX was originally written by Aric Hagberg, Dan Schult, and Pieter Swart,
and has been developed with the help of many others. Thanks to everyone who has
improved NetworkX by contributing code, bug reports (and fixes), documentation,
and input on design, features, and the future of NetworkX.

Contributions
-------------

This section aims to provide a list of people and projects that have
contributed to ``networkx``. It is intended to be an *inclusive* list, and
anyone who has contributed and wishes to make that contribution known is
welcome to add an entry into this file.  Generally, no name should be added to
this list without the approval of the person associated with that name.

Creating a comprehensive list of contributors can be difficult, and the list
within this file is almost certainly incomplete.  Contributors include
testers, bug reporters, contributors who wish to remain anonymous, funding
sources, academic advisors, end users, and even build/integration systems (such
as `TravisCI <https://travis-ci.org>`_).

Do you want to make your contribution known? If you have commit access, edit
this file and add your name. If you do not have commit access, feel free to
open an `issue <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/issues/new>`_, submit a
`pull request <https://github.com/networkx/networkx/compare/>`_, or get in
contact with one of the official team
`members <https://github.com/networkx?tab=members>`_.

A supplementary (but still incomplete) list of contributors is given by the
list of names that have commits in ``networkx``'s
`git <http://git-scm.com>`_ repository. This can be obtained via::

    git log --raw | grep "^Author: " | sort | uniq

A historical, partial listing of contributors and their contributions to some
of the earlier versions of NetworkX can be found
