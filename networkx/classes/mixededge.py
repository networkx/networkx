class MixedEdgeGraph:
    """Base class for mixed-edge graphs.

    A mixed-edge graph stores nodes and different kinds of edges using a
    composition of networkx graphs.

    The edges can represent non-directed (i.e. `networkx.Graph`), or
    directed (i.e. `networkx.DiGraph`) edge connections among nodes. Nodes can be
    any nodes that can be represented in `networkx.Graph`, and `networkx.DiGraph`.

    Edges are represented as links between nodes with optional
    key/value attributes.

    .. warning:: MixedEdgeGraph is an experimental feature that is subject to change
        without deprecation. Please use with caution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graphs : List of Graph | DiGraph
        A list of networkx single-edge graphs.
    edge_types : List of str
        A list of names for each edge type.
    attr : keyword arguments, optional (default= no attributes)
        Attributes to add to graph as key=value pairs.

    Notes
    -----
    Besides the changes mentioned below, a ``MixedEdgeGraph`` matches
    the entire API provided by the Graph/DiGraph classes.

    **Changes compared to existing networkx graphs:**

    Compared to `networkx.Graph` and `networkx.DiGraph`, a ``MixedEdgeGraph`` has
    a different method for initializing the graph and adding edges.
    When adding/removing/update edges to the graph, if that edge type
    does not exist, then an error will be raised. Users should explicitly
    add an edge type graph via the ``add_edge_type`` function.

    Moreover, computing an ``edge_subgraph`` is not supported for
    ``MixedEdgeGraph``.

    **Edges, Adjacencies and Degree:**

    Compared to single-edge networkx graphs, ``MixedEdgeGraph`` implements
    these as functions rather than cached properties.

    **Neighbors:**
    Compared to single-edge graphs, neighbors in a ``MixedEdgeGraph`` of a node is
    defined as any other node with an edge connected to the node that is being checked.

    **Keywords:**
    Since ``MixedEdgeGraph`` comprises of possibly many different edge types.
    In the API, there are a few keywords: 'any' or 'all'. Within the API, 'any'
    means any edge type, whereas 'all' refers to all edge types.

        may be handled in different ways. There are four types of copies
        of a graph that people might want. See :meth:`networkx.Graph.copy`
        for doc string.

        Parameters
        ----------
        as_view : bool, optional (default=False)
            If True, the returned graph-view provides a read-only view
            of the original graph without actually copying any data.

        Returns
        -------
        G : Graph
            A copy of the graph.
