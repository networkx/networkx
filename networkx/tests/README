These files are for testing the methods and functions in NetworkX.
The pytest testing package is required for all tests:
https://pytest.org

The tests also demonstrate the usage of many of the features of NetworkX.

There are a few ways to run the tests. 

The simplest way is to import networkx and run the test() function.

>>> import networkx
>>> networkx.test()

or::

   python -c "import networkx; networkx.test()"

If you have the source package and the pytest testing package you
can test the complete package from the unpacked source directory with::

   PYTHONPATH=. pytest networkx
