"""Release data for NetworkX.

When NetworkX is imported a number of steps are followed to determine
the version information.

   1) If the release is not a development release (dev=False), then version
      information is read from version.py, a file containing statically
      defined version information.  This file should exist on every
      downloadable release of NetworkX since setup.py creates it during
      packaging/installation.  However, version.py might not exist if one
      is running NetworkX from the mercurial repository.  In the event that
      version.py does not exist, then no vcs information will be available.

   2) If the release is a development release, then version information
      is read dynamically, when possible.  If no dynamic information can be
      read, then an attempt is made to read the information from version.py.
      If version.py does not exist, then no vcs information will be available.

Clarification:
      version.py is created only by setup.py

When setup.py creates version.py, it does so before packaging/installation.
So the created file is included in the source distribution.  When a user
downloads a tar.gz file and extracts the files, the files will not be in a
live version control repository.  So when the user runs setup.py to install
NetworkX, we must make sure write_versionfile() does not overwrite the
revision information contained in the version.py that was included in the
tar.gz file. This is why write_versionfile() includes an early escape.
