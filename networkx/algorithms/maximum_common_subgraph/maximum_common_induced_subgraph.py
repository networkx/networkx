"""Maximum common induced subgraph algorithms

A common induced subgraph of graphs $G$ and $H$ is an induced subgraph of $G$
that is isomorphic to an induced subgraph of $H$.  A `maximum common induced
subgraph`_ is a common induced subgraph with as many nodes as possible.

The function :func:`max_common_induced_subgraph` finds the maximum common
induced subgraph of two graphs using a variant of the McSplit algorithm. [1]_
The function :func:`common_induced_subgraph` solves the decision problem: for a
given `target`, it finds a common induced subgraph with at least `target` nodes,
if one exists.  Both of these functions can optionally be called with the
restriction that the common subgraph be connected.

The function :func:`weak_modular_product_mcis` provides an alternative approach to
solving the optimisation problem: it finds a maximum clique in the weak modular
product graph. [2]_

The function :func:`ismags_mcis` is a wrapper for convienience around
:func:`networkx.algorithms.isomorphism.ISMAGS.largest_common_subgraph`; this
provides another alternative approach to solving the optimisation problem.

    Find a common induced subgraph with at least a given number of nodes


    This is the decision version of the :func:`max_common_induced_subgraph`
    function.

    Optionally, nodes and/or edges can be labelled using the `node_label` and
    `edge_label` parameters.  If these are used, the algorithm will search for
    subgraphs of G and H that have identical labels.

    If the `connected` parameter is set to True, the function finds a maximum
    common connected induced subgraph.


    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        An undirected graph.
    H : NetworkX graph
        An undirected graph.
    target : int
        The found subgraph must have at least `target` nodes
    node_label : None, string or function, optional (default=None)
        If this is None, nodes are unlabelled.

        If this is a string, then node labels will be accessed via the node
        attribute with this key (that is, the label of node `v` will be
        `G.nodes[v][node_label]`).

        If this is a function, the label of a node is the value returned by
        the function. The function must accept exactly one positional
        argument: the dictionary of node attributes for that node. The
        label returned by the function must be hashable.

    edge_label : None, string or function, optional (default=None)
        If this is None, edges are unlabelled.

        If this is a string, then edge labels will be accessed via the edge
        attribute with this key (that is, the label of the edge joining `u`
        to `v` will be `G.edges[u, v][edge_label]`).

        If this is a function, the label of an edge is the value returned by
        the function. The function must accept exactly one positional
        argument: the dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The
        label returned by the function must be hashable and must not be None.

    connected : boolean, optional (default=False)
        If this is True, the algorithm will search for a maximum common
        *connected* induced subgraph.


    Returns
    -------
    map : dict or None
        A dictionary whose keys are a subset of the node set of G, and whose
        values are a subset of the node set of H.  The subgraph of G induced by
        the keys is a maximum common subgraph of G and H.  This is isomorphic
        to the subgraph of H induced by the dictionary's values.  The mapping
        given by the dictionary is an isomorphism from the first of these
        subgraphs to the second.

        If no common subgraph with at least `target` nodes is found, None is
        returned.


    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If G or H is directed or a multigraph

    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If G or H has self-loops


    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm used is a simplified variant of McSplit. [1]_  The McSplit
    algorithm builds up a partial map from the node set of G to the node
    set of H, and keeps track of possible additional node-node assignments
    using a partitioning procedure.  For simplicity, the NetworkX version
    creates new lists when partitioning, rather than modifying lists
    in-place as in the original McSplit implementation.

    The implementation currently does not support directed graphs, multigraphs,
    or graphs with self-loops.

    maximum clique solver to solve the *maximum* common subgraph problem; they
    find that this approach is very effective for labelled graphs.

    subgraphs of G and H that have identical labels.

    This is a small wrapper for convenience around
    :func:`networkx.algorithms.isomorphism.ISMAGS.largest_common_subgraph`.

    This function does not support finding a maximum common *connected* induced
    subgraph.


    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        An undirected graph.
    H : NetworkX graph
        An undirected graph.
    node_label : None, string or function, optional (default=None)
        If this is None, nodes are unlabelled.

        If this is a string, then node labels will be accessed via the node
        attribute with this key (that is, the label of node `v` will be
        `G.nodes[v][node_label]`).

        If this is a function, the label of a node is the value returned by
        the function. The function must accept exactly one positional
        argument: the dictionary of node attributes for that node. The
        label returned by the function must be hashable.

    edge_label : None, string or function, optional (default=None)
        If this is None, edges are unlabelled.

        If this is a string, then edge labels will be accessed via the edge
        attribute with this key (that is, the label of the edge joining `u`
        to `v` will be `G.edges[u, v][edge_label]`).

        If this is a function, the label of an edge is the value returned by
        the function. The function must accept exactly one positional
        argument: the dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The
        label returned by the function must be hashable and must not be None.


    Returns
    -------
    map : dict
        A dictionary whose keys are a subset of the node set of G, and whose
        values are a subset of the node set of H.  The subgraph of G induced by
        the keys is a maximum common subgraph of G and H.  This is isomorphic
        to the subgraph of H induced by the dictionary's values.  The mapping
        given by the dictionary is an isomorphism from the first of these
        subgraphs to the second.


    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If G or H is directed or a multigraph

    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If G or H has self-loops
