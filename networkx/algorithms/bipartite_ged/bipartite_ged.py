        Parameters
        ----------
        cost_function : str or CostFunction (default: "const")
            If `str`, name of the :class:`.CostFunction` used for the node matching :

            * `const` : A cost function with constant costs

            * `riesen` : A cost function taking adjacent edges
              edit costs into account to improve the matching

            * `neighborhood` : A cost function taking adjacent edges and
              neighbors edit costs into account to improve the matching


            Else, the :class:`.CostFunction` instance to be used. The cost function
            must follow the design of the :class:`.CostFunction` protocol.
            (See *Warnings* section)

            If a :class:`.CostFunction` instance is given, the edit costs
            parameters will be ignored.

            By default, a :class:`.ConstantCostFunction` will be used,
            with the provided edit costs (of 1, by default).

        cns : int|float (default: 1)
            Node substitution cost (cannot be negative)

        cni : int|float (default: 1)
            Node insertion and deletion costs (cannot be negative nor zero)

        ces : int|float (default: 1)
            Edge substitution cost (cannot be negative)

        cei : int|float (default: 1)
            Edge insertion and deletion costs (cannot be negative nor zero)

        compare_nodes : Callable, optional
            Node comparison function. It defines how nodes can be considered
            equivalent. If two matched nodes are equivalent, substitution is
            not required anymore (the edit cost becomes 0).
            It will be called like

            .. code-block:: python

                compare_nodes(u, v, g1, g2)

            where `u` is a node of `g1`, and `v` a node of `g2`.

            Should return `True` if `u` and `v` are equivalent.

            If `None`, a constant cost will be used in all cases.

        compare_edges : Callable, optional
            Edge comparison function. Same as `compare_nodes`, it defines how
            edges can be considered equivalent (making the substitution cost 0).
            It will be called like

            .. code-block:: python

                compare_edges((u1, u2), (v1, v2), g1, g2)

            where `u1` and `u2` are nodes of `g1`, and `v1` and `v2` are
            nodes of `g2`. Also, there must be an edge between `u1` and
            `u2` as well as between `v1` and `v2`.

            Should return `True` if these edges are equivalent.

            If `None`, a constant cost will be used in all cases.

        solver : str or Solver (default: "lsap")
            If `str`, name of the LSAP solver :

            * `lsap` : A solver using the Jonker-Volgenant Algorithm (`scipy`)

            Else, the :class:`.Solver` instance to be used.

            The solver must follow the design of the :class:`.Solver` protocol.

            By default, a :class:`.SolverLSAP` will be used.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If the given cost is not an `int` or a `float`
        ValueError
            If a parameter does not match the constraints

        Warnings
        --------
        If a custom cost function or a custom solver is given, it must follow
        the design of the :class:`.CostFunction` or the :class:`.Solver` protocol.

        A custom cost function should be based on an elementary :class:`.CostFunction`
        (eg :class:`.ConstantCostFunction`). As it aims to enhance the matching result
        by increasing some edit costs, using this cost function to compute the
        approximation may result in an overastimated GED.

        Every built-in :class:`.CostFunction` is based on the :class:`.ConstantCostFunction`.
        If a custom cost function does not implement elementary costs, it
        should provide a `ccf` property to access the elementary cost function.
        If this property is not found, the custom cost function will be considered as
        an elementary cost function. If it was not supposed to be the case, the
        result of the approximation might be overestimated.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the given mapping is either incomplete or asymmetric. (for

        KeyError
            If a wrong node appears in `rho` or `varrho`.

            Only if `rho` and `varrho` are not `None`.

        Examples
        --------
        A simple use case :

        >>> import networkx as nx
        >>> g1 = nx.complete_graph(5)
        >>> g2 = nx.complete_graph(6)
        >>> bpged = nx.BipartiteGED("const", 1, 1, 1, 1)
        >>> bpged.ged(g1, g2)
        21

        Note that the graphs used here are not labelled, hence node or edge
        comparison function cannot be defined. This results in the substitution
        cost being used in all cases as the algorithm cannot consider two
        nodes or two edges equivalent.

        Now by creating custom graphs, we can give the comparison functions
        to compute a more accurate approximation of the GED :

        >>> # We create labelled graphs :
        >>> g1, g2 = nx.Graph(), nx.Graph()
        >>> g1.add_nodes_from(
        ...     [("u1", {"Label": 1}), ("u2", {"Label": 2}), ("u3", {"Label": 1})]
        ... )
        >>> g1.add_edges_from(
        ...     [("u1", "u2", {"weight": 1}), ("u2", "u3", {"weight": 2})]
        ... )
        >>> g2.add_nodes_from([("v1", {"Label": 1}), ("v2", {"Label": 2})])
        >>> g2.add_edge("v1", "v2", weight=1)
        >>> # And we define the comparison functions :
        >>> def compare_nodes(u, v, g1, g2):
        ...     return g1.nodes[u]["Label"] == g2.nodes[v]["Label"]
        >>> def compare_edges(e1, e2, g1, g2):
        ...     return g1[e1[0]][e1[1]]["weight"] == g2[e2[0]][e2[1]]["weight"]
        >>> # Now we can recreate our GED estimator and compute the approximation :
        >>> bpged = nx.BipartiteGED("const", 1, 1, 1, 1, compare_nodes, compare_edges)
        >>> bpged.ged(g1, g2)
        3

        This is also possible to provide a :class:`.CostFunction` (see
        :mod:`.costfunctions`), or to use the :class:`.RiesenCostFunction` or the
        :class:`.NeighborhoodCostFunction` which are more complex cost functions, and
        particularly useful for graphs with a larger number of nodes and edges.
