Classes solving a Linear Sum Assignment Problem (*LSAP*)

Solving a *LSAP* allows to compute an optimum assignment
of each element from the two sets $A$ and $B$,
given a cost matrix $C$ where $C_{i, j}$ represents
the matching cost between $a_i \\in A$ and $b_j \\in B$

Sets $A$ and $B$ must have the same size ($|A| = |B| = n$).
Let $\\{ \\phi_1, \\dots, \\phi_{n} \\}$ be the solution of the *LSAP*
where element $a_i$ is matched with the element $b_{\\phi_i}$.

This solution minimizes the
matching cost $\\sum_{i = 1}^n C_{i, \\phi_i}$

            of the element assigned to `j` (inverse of rho)

        Examples
        --------
        In this example, we use the :func:`.compute_bipartite_cost_matrix`
        function. We create 2 graphs of 3 and 2 nodes. The cost
        matrix will be a (2 + 3) * (2 + 3) matrix, and the solutions
        will be two `numpy` arrays of size (2 + 3).

        >>> import networkx as nx
        >>> # We create two very simple graphs
        >>> g1, g2 = nx.Graph(), nx.Graph()
        >>> g1.add_nodes_from(
        ...     [("u1", {"Label": 1}), ("u2", {"Label": 2}), ("u3", {"Label": 1})]
        ... )
        >>> g1.add_edges_from([("u1", "u2"), ("u2", "u3")])
        >>> g2.add_nodes_from([("v1", {"Label": 1}), ("v2", {"Label": 2})])
        >>> g2.add_edge("v1", "v2")
        >>> # And we define the function for nodes comparison
        >>> def compare_nodes(u, v, g1, g2):
        ...     return g1.nodes[u]["Label"] == g2.nodes[v]["Label"]
        >>> # We compute the cost matrix using a cost function :
        >>> cf = nx.bipartite_ged.ConstantCostFunction(1, 2, 1, 2, compare_nodes)
        >>> C = nx.bipartite_ged.compute_bipartite_cost_matrix(g1, g2, cf)
        >>> # And we use it along with the solver to find an optimum node matching :
        >>> solver = nx.bipartite_ged.SolverLSAP()
        >>> solver.solve(C)
        (array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]), array([2, 1, 0, 3, 4]))

        The first array corresponds to the indices of the rows of the cost matrix
        (ie, the indices of the nodes from `g1`). The second array contains the
        matched indices of the columns (ie, the indices of the nodes from `g2`).

        For instance, we see that indices 2 and 0 are matched, which means
        node of index 2 from `g1` (`u3`) is matched with node of index 0 from
        `g2` (`v1`). We also see that nodes of indices 0 and 2 are matched,
        but there is no node of index 2 in `g2`. It represents the deletion
        of the node of index 0 from `g1` (`u1`).

        Notes
        -----
        `cost_matrix` must be a square matrix. Hence to ensure the full
        matching in the case of two graphs with different number of nodes,
        empty nodes are added to the matrix. The output arrays will then
        contain indices of nodes that do not exist in the graphs.
        Assume indices $i$ and $j$ are matched :

        * if they both exist in their graphs, it repretents a substitution
        * if only $i$ exists, it represents a deletion
        * if only $j$ exists, it represents an insertion

        If neither of them exist in the graphs, it can be ignored, it does
        not represent any edit operation and is the consequnce of
