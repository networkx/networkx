def cycle_basis(G, root=None, T=None):
    """Returns a list of cycles that form a basis for the cycle space of
    ``G``.

    The `cycle space`_ of a graph is the vector space of its Eulerian
    subgraphs, with vector addition defined by symmetric difference of
    the subgraphs. A `cycle basis`_ is a basis for this vector space.
    It is a minimal collection of cycles such that any cycle in the
    network can be written as a "sum" (in the sense of symmetric
    difference, as stated above) of cycles in the basis.

    Cycle bases are useful when considering a graph as an electrical
    circuit that complies with `Kirchhoff's circuit laws`_.

    .. _cycle basis: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_basis
    .. _Kirchhoff's circuit laws: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph

    root : node, optional
        A starting node to use when computing the basis.

    T : NetworkX graph, optional
        Use this particular spanning tree when computing the cycles
        induced by parallel edges joining pairs of nodes in a
        multigraph. This must be a NetworkX graph object representing a
        spanning tree of the graph ``G``. If not provided, a minimum
        spanning tree will be computed.

        This argument is ignored if ``G`` is not a multigraph.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        A list of cycles, each of which is itself a list of nodes
        representing a cycle in the graph.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G=nx.Graph()
    >>> nx.add_cycle(G, [0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> nx.add_cycle(G, [0, 3, 4, 5])
    >>> nx.cycle_basis(G, 0)
    [[3, 4, 5, 0], [1, 2, 3, 0]]

    T : NetworkX graph
        A spanning tree for the graph ``G``, for example, as computed by
        :func:`networkx.minimum_spanning_tree`.

    output_tree : bool
        If this is ``False`` (the default), then the function returns
        only the chords. If this is ``True``, then the function returns
        the chords and the spanning tree from which the chords were
        computed.

    Returns
    -------
    NetworkX graph or a pair of NetworkX graphs
        If ``output_tree`` is ``False`` (the default) then this function
        returns a graph containing only the chords of ``G`` with respect
        to the spanning tree ``T`` (or a minimum spanning tree if ``T``
        is not specified). The type of the graph is the same as the type
        of ``G``.

        If ``output_tree`` is ``True``, then this function returns a
        pair whose left element is the graph of chords as described
        above and whose right element is the spanning tree used to
        compute those chords. If ``T`` is provided, it is returned
        unmodified.

    Examples
    --------
    If no spanning tree is provided, a minimum spanning tree is chosen
    for you::

        >>> import networkx as nx
        >>> e = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6),
        ...      (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)]
        >>> G = nx.Graph(e)
        >>> C, T = nx.chords(G, output_tree=True)
        >>> sorted(C.edges())
        [(2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)]
        >>> sorted(T.edges())
        [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)]

    Notes
    -----
    This is a direct implementation of the definition of chords.  It
    constructs the minimum spanning tree of ``G`` and then removes the
    edges in that tree from ``G``.

def find_cycle(G, source=None, orientation='original'):
    """
    Returns the edges of a cycle found via a directed, depth-first traversal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A directed/undirected graph/multigraph.

    source : node, list of nodes
        The node from which the traversal begins. If None, then a source
        is chosen arbitrarily and repeatedly until all edges from each node in
        the graph are searched.

    orientation : 'original' | 'reverse' | 'ignore'
        For directed graphs and directed multigraphs, edge traversals need not
        respect the original orientation of the edges. When set to 'reverse',
        then every edge will be traversed in the reverse direction. When set to
        'ignore', then each directed edge is treated as a single undirected
        edge that can be traversed in either direction. For undirected graphs
        and undirected multigraphs, this parameter is meaningless and is not
        consulted by the algorithm.

    Returns
    -------
    edges : directed edges
        A list of directed edges indicating the path taken for the loop. If
        no cycle is found, then an exception is raised. For graphs, an
        edge is of the form `(u, v)` where `u` and `v` are the tail and head
        of the edge as determined by the traversal. For multigraphs, an edge is
        of the form `(u, v, key)`, where `key` is the key of the edge. When the
        graph is directed, then `u` and `v` are always in the order of the
        actual directed edge. If orientation is 'ignore', then an edge takes
        the form `(u, v, key, direction)` where direction indicates if the edge
        was followed in the forward (tail to head) or reverse (head to tail)
        direction. When the direction is forward, the value of `direction`
        is 'forward'. When the direction is reverse, the value of `direction`
        is 'reverse'.
        
    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNoCycle
        If no cycle was found.

    Examples
    --------
    In this example, we construct a DAG and find, in the first call, that there
    are no directed cycles, and so an exception is raised. In the second call,
    we ignore edge orientations and find that there is an undirected cycle.
    Note that the second call finds a directed cycle while effectively
    traversing an undirected graph, and so, we found an "undirected cycle".
    This means that this DAG structure does not form a directed tree (which
    is also known as a polytree).

    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0,1), (0,2), (1,2)])
    >>> try:
    ...    find_cycle(G, orientation='original')
    ... except:
    ...    pass
    ...
    >>> list(find_cycle(G, orientation='ignore'))
    [(0, 1, 'forward'), (1, 2, 'forward'), (0, 2, 'reverse')]
