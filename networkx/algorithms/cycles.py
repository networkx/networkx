def cycle_basis(G,root=None):
    """ Returns a list of cycles which form a basis for cycles of G.

    A basis for cycles of a network is a minimal collection of
    cycles such that any cycle in the network can be written
    as a sum of cycles in the basis.  Here summation of cycles
    is defined as "exclusive or" of the edges. Cycle bases are
    useful, e.g. when deriving equations for electric circuits
    using Kirchhoff's Laws.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph
    root : node, optional
       Specify starting node for basis.

    Returns
    -------
    A list of cycle lists.  Each cycle list is a list of nodes
    which forms a cycle (loop) in G.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G=nx.Graph()
    >>> G.add_cycle([0,1,2,3])
    >>> G.add_cycle([0,3,4,5])
    >>> print(nx.cycle_basis(G,0))

    """Find simple cycles (elementary circuits) of a directed graph.

    An simple cycle, or elementary circuit, is a closed path where no
    node appears twice, except that the first and last node are the same.
    Two elementary circuits are distinct if they are not cyclic permutations
    of each other.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX DiGraph
       A directed graph
    list_of_nodes : (optional) a list of nodes
    list_of_edges : (optional) a list of edges
    

    Returns
    -------
    A list of circuits, where each circuit is a list of nodes, with the first
    and last node being the same. The list of circuits can be negatively 
    filtered by nodes (only circuits NOT containing the nodes defined in 
    list_of_nodes are included in the results) or positively filtered by edges 
    (only circuits containing the edges defined in list_of_edges are included
    in the result). The filtering options can be used independently or together.
    
    Example:
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)])
    >>> nx.simple_cycles(G)

    >>> nx.simple_cycles(G,[0])
    [[1, 2, 1], [2, 2]]
    >>> nx.simple_cycles(G,[0],[[1,2]])
    [[1, 2, 1]]
    >>> nx.simple_cycles(G,[],[[1,2]])

    Notes
    -----
    The implementation follows pp. 79-80 in [1]_.

    The time complexity is O((n+e)(c+1)) for n nodes, e edges and c
    elementary circuits.
