def cycle_basis(G, root=None):
    """ Returns a list of cycles which form a basis for cycles of G.

    A basis for cycles of a network is a minimal collection of
    cycles such that any cycle in the network can be written
    as a sum of cycles in the basis.  Here summation of cycles
    is defined as "exclusive or" of the edges. Cycle bases are
    useful, e.g. when deriving equations for electric circuits
    using Kirchhoff's Laws.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph
    root : node, optional
       Specify starting node for basis.

    Returns
    -------
    A list of cycle lists.  Each cycle list is a list of nodes
    which forms a cycle (loop) in G.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph()
    >>> nx.add_cycle(G, [0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> nx.add_cycle(G, [0, 3, 4, 5])

    To filter the cycles so that they don't include certain nodes or edges,
    copy your graph and eliminate those nodes or edges before calling

def find_cycle(G, source=None, orientation='original'):
    """
    Returns the edges of a cycle found via a directed, depth-first traversal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A directed/undirected graph/multigraph.

    source : node, list of nodes
        The node from which the traversal begins. If None, then a source
        is chosen arbitrarily and repeatedly until all edges from each node in
        the graph are searched.

    orientation : 'original' | 'reverse' | 'ignore'
        For directed graphs and directed multigraphs, edge traversals need not
        respect the original orientation of the edges. When set to 'reverse',
        then every edge will be traversed in the reverse direction. When set to
        'ignore', then each directed edge is treated as a single undirected
        edge that can be traversed in either direction. For undirected graphs
        and undirected multigraphs, this parameter is meaningless and is not
        consulted by the algorithm.

    Returns
    -------
    edges : directed edges
        A list of directed edges indicating the path taken for the loop. If
        no cycle is found, then an exception is raised. For graphs, an
        edge is of the form `(u, v)` where `u` and `v` are the tail and head
        of the edge as determined by the traversal. For multigraphs, an edge is
        of the form `(u, v, key)`, where `key` is the key of the edge. When the
        graph is directed, then `u` and `v` are always in the order of the
        actual directed edge. If orientation is 'ignore', then an edge takes
        the form `(u, v, key, direction)` where direction indicates if the edge
        was followed in the forward (tail to head) or reverse (head to tail)
        direction. When the direction is forward, the value of `direction`
        is 'forward'. When the direction is reverse, the value of `direction`
        is 'reverse'.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNoCycle
        If no cycle was found.

    Examples
    --------
    In this example, we construct a DAG and find, in the first call, that there
    are no directed cycles, and so an exception is raised. In the second call,
    we ignore edge orientations and find that there is an undirected cycle.
    Note that the second call finds a directed cycle while effectively
    traversing an undirected graph, and so, we found an "undirected cycle".
    This means that this DAG structure does not form a directed tree (which
    is also known as a polytree).
