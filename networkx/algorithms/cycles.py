    """Returns a list of cycles which form a basis for cycles of G.

    The `cycle space`_ of a graph is the vector space of its Eulerian
    subgraphs, with vector addition defined by symmetric difference of
    the subgraphs. A `cycle basis`_ is a basis for this vector space.
    It is a minimal collection of cycles such that any cycle in the
    network can be written as a "sum" (in the sense of symmetric
    difference, as stated above) of cycles in the basis.

    Cycle bases are useful when considering a graph as an electrical
    circuit that complies with `Kirchhoff's circuit laws`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph

    root : node, optional
        A starting node to use when computing the basis.

    T : NetworkX graph, optional
        Use this particular spanning tree when computing the cycles
        induced by parallel edges joining pairs of nodes in a
        multigraph. This must be a NetworkX graph object representing a
        spanning tree of the graph ``G``. If not provided, a minimum
        spanning tree will be computed.

        This argument is ignored if ``G`` is not a multigraph.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        A list of cycles, each of which is itself a list of nodes
        representing a cycle in the graph.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph()
    >>> nx.add_cycle(G, [0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> nx.add_cycle(G, [0, 3, 4, 5])
    >>> print(nx.cycle_basis(G, 0))

    output_tree : bool
        If this is ``False`` (the default), then the function returns
        only the chords. If this is ``True``, then the function returns
        the chords and the spanning tree from which the chords were
        computed.

    Returns
    -------
    NetworkX graph or a pair of NetworkX graphs

        If ``output_tree`` is ``False`` (the default) then this function
        returns a graph containing only the chords of ``G`` with respect
        to the spanning tree ``T`` (or a minimum spanning tree if ``T``
        is not specified). The type of the graph is the same as the type
        of ``G``.

        If ``output_tree`` is ``True``, then this function returns a
        pair whose left element is the graph of chords as described
        above and whose right element is the spanning tree used to
        compute those chords. If ``T`` is provided, it is returned
        unmodified.

    Examples
    --------
    If no spanning tree is provided, a minimum spanning tree is chosen
    for you::

        >>> import networkx as nx
        >>> e = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6),
        ...      (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)]
        >>> G = nx.Graph(e)
        >>> C, T = nx.chords(G, output_tree=True)
        >>> sorted(C.edges())
        [(2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)]
        >>> sorted(T.edges())
        [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)]

    Notes
    -----
    This is a direct implementation of the definition of chords.  It
    constructs the minimum spanning tree of ``G`` and then removes the
    edges in that tree from ``G``.

def find_cycle(G, source=None, orientation="original"):
    """Returns a cycle found via depth-first traversal.

    The cycle is a list of edges indicating the cyclic path.
    Orientation of directed edges is controlled by `orientation`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A directed/undirected graph/multigraph.

    source : node, list of nodes
        The node from which the traversal begins. If None, then a source
        is chosen arbitrarily and repeatedly until all edges from each node in
        the graph are searched.

    orientation : None | 'original' | 'reverse' | 'ignore' (default: None)
        For directed graphs and directed multigraphs, edge traversals need not
        respect the original orientation of the edges.
        When set to 'reverse' every edge is traversed in the reverse direction.
        When set to 'ignore', every edge is treated as undirected.
        When set to 'original', every edge is treated as directed.
        In all three cases, the yielded edge tuples add a last entry to
        indicate the direction in which that edge was traversed.
        If orientation is None, the yielded edge has no direction indicated.
        The direction is respected, but not reported.

    Returns
    -------
    edges : directed edges
        A list of directed edges indicating the path taken for the loop.
        If no cycle is found, then an exception is raised.
        For graphs, an edge is of the form `(u, v)` where `u` and `v`
        are the tail and head of the edge as determined by the traversal.
        For multigraphs, an edge is of the form `(u, v, key)`, where `key` is
        the key of the edge. When the graph is directed, then `u` and `v`
        are always in the order of the actual directed edge.
        If orientation is not None then the edge tuple is extended to include
        the direction of traversal ('forward' or 'reverse') on that edge.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNoCycle
        If no cycle was found.

    Examples
    --------
    In this example, we construct a DAG and find, in the first call, that there
    are no directed cycles, and so an exception is raised. In the second call,
    we ignore edge orientations and find that there is an undirected cycle.
    Note that the second call finds a directed cycle while effectively
    traversing an undirected graph, and so, we found an "undirected cycle".
    This means that this DAG structure does not form a directed tree (which
    is also known as a polytree).

    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)])
    >>> nx.find_cycle(G, orientation="original")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    networkx.exception.NetworkXNoCycle: No cycle found.
    >>> list(nx.find_cycle(G, orientation="ignore"))
