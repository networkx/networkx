def pwp(G, k=1):
    """Return the PWP indirect influences and indirect dependences
    of the nodes in the graph.

    When two nodes on a DiGraph are connected with a directed
    edge we say that the source exerts a direct influence over the
    target and the target perceives a direct dependency from the source.
    The amount of such influences or dependences is given by the
    weight of the edge between them.

    PWP computes the indirect influences and dependences for all nodes
    in a DiGraph  via the exponential formula described in references.
    We call indirect influences and indirect dependences to the output of
    PWP and its related methods: Heat Kernel, MICMAC and PageRank.

    Parameters
    -----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX [Di]Graph

    k : integer, optional
      Paramenter of the PWP method, default 1. Comes from the formula:
      (e^{k*adj(G)} - I)/(e^k - 1), where adj(G) represents the
      adjacency matrix of G and I is the identity matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    influences : dictionary
       Dictionary of PWP indirect influences.
    dependences : dictionary
       Dictionary of PWP indirect dependences.
       
    Examples
    --------
    >>> G=nx.DiGraph(nx.path_graph(4))
    >>> influences,dependences = nx.pwp(G)

    Notes
    -----
    This function uses the SciPy library to make the computations.
    A NetworkX DiGraph is preferred because on an undirected Graph
    indirect dependences are equal to indirect influences. Every
    NetworkX Graph will be converted to a NetworkX DiGraph.

    The name PWP comes from "nearly Poisson Weighted Path" and was
    proposed by Rafael DÃ­az. We always refer to this method as PWP
    never as its justification.
