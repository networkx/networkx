"""Functions for finding node and edge dominating sets.

A `dominating set`_ for an undirected graph *G* with vertex set *V*
and edge set *E* is a subset *D* of *V* such that every vertex not in
*D* is adjacent to at least one member of *D*. An `edge dominating set`_
is a subset *F* of *E* such that every edge not in *F* is
incident to an endpoint of at least one edge in *F*.

def min_weighted_dominating_set(G, weight=None, _postprocessing=False):
    r"""Returns a dominating set that approximates the minimum weight node
    dominating set.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        Undirected graph.

    weight : string
        The node attribute storing the weight of an edge. If provided,
        the node attribute with this key must be a number for each
        node. If not provided, each node is assumed to have weight one.

    Other parameters
    ----------------
    _postprocessing : bool
        If ``True``, an additional postprocessing step is performed that
        reduces the size of the returned dominating set but increases
        the asymptotic time complexity of this function.

    Returns
    -------
    min_weight_dominating_set : set
        A set of nodes, the sum of whose weights is no more than `(\log
        w(V)) w(V^*)`, where `w(V)` denotes the sum of the weights of
        each node in the graph and `w(V^*)` denotes the sum of the
        weights of each node in the minimum weight dominating set.

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm computes an approximate minimum weighted dominating
    set for the graph `G`. The returned solution has weight `(\log
    w(V)) w(V^*)`, where `w(V)` denotes the sum of the weights of each
    node in the graph and `w(V^*)` denotes the sum of the weights of
    each node in the minimum weight dominating set for the graph.

    This implementation of the algorithm runs in `O(n^2)` time (ignoring
    logarithmic factors), where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph.

    If the ``_postprocessing`` keyword argument is ``True``, then an
    additional postprocessing heuristic from [2]_ is run. This
    additional postprocessing increases the running time of this
    function to `O(n(n + m))`.
