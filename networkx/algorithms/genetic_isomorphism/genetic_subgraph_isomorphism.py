    Perform crossover operation to generate new solutions.

    Given two graphs `G1` and `G2` and their sublists of subgraphs `G1_sublists` and `G2_sublists`,
    this function generates `num_solutions` new solutions by performing a crossover operation on the
    sublists. The algorithm first chooses a random sub_graph size from the sublists. Then it chooses
    two subgraphs with the same size randomly from each of the sublists, and combine them to form a
    new solution. If a solution with the same combination already exists, the algorithm generates a
    new pair of subgraphs with the same size and add them to the new solutions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G1_nodes: A set of nodes in the graph G1.
    G2_nodes: A set of nodes in the graph G2.
    G1_sublists: A dictionary that maps sub_graph_size to a list of subgraphs with the same size
    in G1.
    G2_sublists: A dictionary that maps sub_graph_size to a list of subgraphs with the same size
    in G2.
    num_solutions: An integer that specifies the number of new solutions to generate.

def find_subgraph_isomorphism_with_genetic_algorithm(G1, G2, ALPHA):
    """
    Since subgraph isomorphism is an NP-hard problem, a
    GA is appropriate. A GA generates a set of initial solutions
    and lets them evolve over a number of iterations. When GA
    meets some condition, the best solution is returned and the
    algorithm terminates. Our algorithm replaces 20 percent
    of the population per generation and uses local optimisation heuristics after crossover and mutation (hybrid or
    memetic GA).

    Improving runtime
    -----------------
    The find_subgraph_isomorphism_with_genetic_algorithm function uses multiprocessing to improve its runtime.
    multiprocessing distributes the computation across multiple cores.
    This optimization allow for faster execution of the algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G1 : NetworkX DiGraph
        A (dirceted) graph
    G2 : NetworkX DiGraph
        A (dirceted) graph
    ALPHA: folat
        A threshold value that indicates how much similar the ftness' score should be

    Returns
    -------
    True iff the minimal fitness' score between all the subgraphs of G1 and G2 it smaller than the given alpha

    Notes
    -----
    In computer science and operations research,
    a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by
    the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger
    class of evolutionary algorithms (EA).
    Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality
    solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on
    biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.
