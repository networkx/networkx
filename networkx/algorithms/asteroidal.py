Algorithms for asteroidal triples and asteroidal numbers in graphs.

An asteroidal triple in a graph ``G`` is a set of three non-adjacent nodes
``{u, v, w}`` such that there exists a path between any two of them that avoids
the closed neighborhood of the third. More formally, ``v_j`` and ``v_k`` belong to the same
connected component of ``G - N[v_i]``, where ``N[v_i]`` denotes the closed neighborhood
of ``v_i``. A graph that does not contain any asteroidal triples is called
an "AT-free" graph. The class of AT-free graphs is a graph class for which
many NP-complete problems such as independent set and coloring are solvable in polynomial time.

def find_asteroidal_triple(G):
    r"""Find an asteroidal triple in a graph.

    An asteroidal triple is a triple of non-adjacent nodes such that
    there exists a path between any two of them that avoids the closed
    neighborhood of the third.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The graph to find an asteroidal triple in.

    Returns
    -------
    list or None
        An asteroidal triple is returned as a list of nodes. If no asteroidal
        triple exists, i.e. the graph is AT-free, then `None` is returned.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If the graph is directed.

    Notes
    -----
    This implements the trivial algorithm in [1]_.
    It checks all independent triples of nodes and whether they are an
    asteroidal triple or not. This is done with the help of a data structure
    called a component structure. The component structure encodes information
    about which nodes belong to the same connected component when the closed
    neighborhood of a third node is removed from the graph.

    The algorithm has a runtime of :math:`O(|V||\overline{E}| + |V||E|)`,
    where the second term is the creation of the component structure.

    """Check if a graph is AT-free.

    The method uses the `find_asteroidal_triple` method to recognize
    an AT-free graph. If no asteroidal triple is found the graph is
    AT-free and `True` is returned. If at least one asteroidal triple is
    found the graph is not AT-free and `False` is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The graph to check whether is AT-free or not.

    Returns
    -------

def _create_component_structure(G):
    r"""Create a modified component structure for a graph.

    A *component structure* is an $n \times n$ array, denoted $c$, where $n$ is
    the number of vertices and each row and column corresponds to a node.

    .. math::
        c_{uv} = \begin{cases} 0, \text{ if } v \in N[u] \\
            k, \text{ if } v \in \text{component } k \text{ of } G \setminus N[u] \end{cases}

    where $k$ is an arbitrary label for each component. The structure is used
    to simplify the detection of asteroidal triples.

    Our implementation uses a modified version of the component structure using dictionaries
    that excludes $v$ from $c_u$ if $v \in N[u]$.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        Undirected graph.

    Returns
    -------
    component_structure : dictionary
        A dictionary of dictionaries, keyed by pairs of nodes.
