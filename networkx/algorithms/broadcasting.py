"""Routines to calculate the broadcast time of certain graphs.

Broadcasting is an information dissemination problem in which a node in a graph,
called the originator, must distribute a message to all other nodes by placing
a series of calls along the edges of the graph. Once informed, other nodes aid
the originator in distributing the message.

The broadcasting must be completed as quickly as possible subject to the
following constraints:
- Each call requires one unit of time.
- A node can only participate in one call per unit of time.
- Each call only involves two adjacent nodes: a sender and a receiver.

    The broadcast center of a graph `G` denotes the set of nodes having
    minimum broadcast time [1]_. This function implements a linear algorithm
    for determining the broadcast center of a tree with ``n`` nodes. As a
    by-product, it also determines the broadcast time from the broadcast center.

    ----------
    G : Graph
        The graph should be an undirected tree.

    Returns
    -------
    b_T, b_C : (int, set) tuple

    ------

    all nodes of the minimum broadcast time from that node [1]_.
    This function returns the minimum broadcast time of `node`.

    node : node, optional (default=None)
        Starting node for the broadcasting. If `None`, the algorithm
