    """Check m-separation among 'x' and 'y' given 'z' in mixed-edge causal graph G, which may
    contain directed, bidirected, and undirected edges.

    This implements the m-separation algorithm TESTSEP presented in [1]_ for ancestral mixed
    graphs. Further checks have ensure that it works for non-ancestral mixed graphs
    (e.g. ADMGs). The algorithm performs a breadth-first search over m-connecting paths
    between 'x' and 'y' (i.e. a path on which every node that is a collider is in 'z', and
    every node that is not a collider is not in 'z'). The algorithm has runtime
    :math:`O(|E| + |V|)` for number of edges :math:`|E|` and number of vertices :math:`|V|`.


    Parameters
    ----------
    G : mixed-edge-graph
        Mixed edge causal graph.
    x : set
        First set of nodes in ``G``.
    y : set
        Second set of nodes in ``G``.
    z : set
        Set of conditioning nodes in ``G``. Can be empty set.
    directed_edge_name : str
        Name of the directed edge, default is directed.
    bidirected_edge_name : str
        Name of the bidirected edge, default is bidirected.
    undirected_edge_name : str
        Name of the undirected edge, default is undirected.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        A boolean that is true if ``x`` is m-separated from ``y`` given ``z`` in ``G``.
