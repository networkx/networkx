    """Return a list of nodes in a shortest path between source and target
    using the A* ("A-star") algorithm.

    There may be more than one shortest path.  This returns only one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node for path

    target : node
       Ending node for path

    heuristic : function
       A function to evaluate the estimate of the distance
       from the a node to the target.  The function takes
       two nodes arguments and must return a number.

    weight: string, optional (default='weight')
       Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNoPath
        If no path exists between source and target.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G=nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> print(nx.astar_path(G,0,4))
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> G=nx.grid_graph(dim=[3,3])  # nodes are two-tuples (x,y)
