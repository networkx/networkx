       undirected graph is a negative cost cycle.

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    In practice  bidirectional Dijkstra is much more than twice as fast as
    ordinary Dijkstra.

    Ordinary Dijkstra expands nodes in a sphere-like manner from the
    source. The radius of this sphere will eventually be the length
    of the shortest path. Bidirectional Dijkstra will expand nodes
    from both the source and the target, making two spheres of half
    this radius. Volume of the first sphere is pi*r*r while the
    others are 2*pi*r/2*r/2, making up half the volume.

    This algorithm is not guaranteed to work if edge weights
    are negative or are floating point numbers
    (overflows and roundoff errors can cause problems).
