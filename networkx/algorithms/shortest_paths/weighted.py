    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph.

    weight : string or function
        If it is callable, `weight` itself is returned. If it is a string,
        it is assumed to be the name of the edge attribute that represents

    -------
    function
        This function returns a callable that accepts exactly three inputs:
        a node, an node adjacent to the first one, and the edge attribute
        dictionary for the eedge joining those nodes. That function returns
        a number representing the weight of an edge.

    If `G` is a multigraph, and `weight` is not callable, the
    minimum edge weight over all parallel edges is returned. If any edge
    does not have an attribute with key `weight`, it is assumed to
    have weight one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node

    target : node
       Ending node

    weight : string or function
       If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
       edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge

def negative_edge_cycle(G, weight='weight'):

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

       edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node.

    target : node
       Ending node.

    Returns
    -------
    length : number
        Shortest path length.

    Returns a tuple of two dictionaries keyed by node.
    The first dictionary stores distance from the source.
    The second stores the path from the source to that node.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNoPath
        If no path exists between source and target.

    Examples

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    In practice  bidirectional Dijkstra is much more than twice as fast as
    ordinary Dijkstra.

    Ordinary Dijkstra expands nodes in a sphere-like manner from the
    source. The radius of this sphere will eventually be the length
    of the shortest path. Bidirectional Dijkstra will expand nodes
    from both the source and the target, making two spheres of half
    this radius. Volume of the first sphere is `\pi*r*r` while the
    others are `2*\pi*r/2*r/2`, making up half the volume.

    This algorithm is not guaranteed to work if edge weights
    are negative or are floating point numbers
    (overflows and roundoff errors can cause problems).

def johnson(G, weight='weight'):
    r"""Uses Johnson's Algorithm to compute shortest paths.

    Johnson's Algorithm finds a shortest path between each pair of
    nodes in a weighted graph even if negative weights are present.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    weight : string or function
       If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
       edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
       joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edge[u][v][weight]``). If no
       such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
       be one.

       If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
       returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
       positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
       dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
       return a number.

    Returns
    -------
    distance : dictionary
       Dictionary, keyed by source and target, of shortest paths.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
       If given graph is not weighted.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> graph = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> graph.add_weighted_edges_from([('0', '3', 3), ('0', '1', -5),
    ... ('0', '2', 2), ('1', '2', 4), ('2', '3', 1)])
    >>> paths = nx.johnson(graph, weight='weight')
    >>> paths['0']['2']
    ['0', '1', '2']

    Notes
    -----
    Johnson's algorithm is suitable even for graphs with negative weights. It
    works by using the Bellman–Ford algorithm to compute a transformation of
    the input graph that removes all negative weights, allowing Dijkstra's
    algorithm to be used on the transformed graph.

    The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n^2 \log n + n m)`,
    where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` the number of edges in the
    graph. For dense graphs, this may be faster than the Floyd–Warshall
    algorithm.
