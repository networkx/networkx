"""
Compute the shortest paths and path lengths between nodes in the graph.

These algorithms work with undirected and directed graphs.

For directed graphs the paths can be computed in the reverse
order by first flipping the edge orientation using R=G.reverse(copy=False).

    Returns
    -------
    path: list or dictionary
        All returned paths include both the source and target in the path.

        If the source and target are both specified, return a single list
        of nodes in a shortest path from the source to the target.

        If only the source is specified, return a dictionary keyed by
        targets with a list of nodes in a shortest path from the source
        to one of the targets.

        If only the target is specified, return a dictionary keyed by
        sources with a list of nodes in a shortest path from one of the
        sources to the target.

        If neither the source nor target are specified return a dictionary
        of dictionaries with path[source][target]=[list of nodes in path].

        If only the source is specified, return a dictionary keyed by

    in the path since the length measures the number of edges followed.

    lengths in the reverse direction use G.reverse(copy=False) first to flip
