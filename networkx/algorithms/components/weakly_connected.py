    Parameters

    G : NetworkX graph

    Returns
    -------
    comp : generator of sets
        A generator of sets of nodes, one for each weakly connected

    Examples
    --------
    Generate a sorted list of weakly connected components, largest first.

    >>> G = nx.path_graph(4, create_using=nx.DiGraph())
    >>> G.add_path([10, 11, 12])
