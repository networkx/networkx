def knotty_centrality(G, compact=True):
    """Return the sub-graph with the highest value of knotty centrality

    Attempts to find the sub-graph of G with the highest value for
    knotty-centrality. Carries out a series of exhaustive searches on
    subsets of the nodes ranked by "indirect" betweenness centrality, then
    carries out a phase of hill-climbing to see whether the sub-graph can
    be improved by adding further nodes.
    
    Written by Erik Ziegler, adapted from original MATLAB code 
    by Murray Shanahan and Mark Wildie

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph 
    compact : bool (optional)
       Calculates the compact knotty centrality (default=True)

    Returns
    -------
    nodes: list
        nodes in the sub-graph with the highest knotty centrality
    kc : float
        the highest value of knotty centrality
        
    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(0,1),(0,2),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(4,5)])
    >>> nodes, kc = nx.knotty_centrality(G,compact=False)

    Notes
    ------
    The knotty centrality definition and algorithm are found in [1]_.
