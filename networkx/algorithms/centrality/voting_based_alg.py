    """Rank nodes using Satisfaction Approval Voting (SAV).

    Satisfaction approval centrality (introduced in [2]_ and based on the
    framework in [3]_ ) lets each node vote on the centrality of its neighbors.
    Thereby, each node x contributes 1/degree(x) points to the total score of
    each neighbor. In other words: node x distributes a total of 1 point equally
    to all neighbors. One interpretation is that a node is more central
    according to this centrality if it has many neighbors which highly rely on
    the connection to this node (they have no, or only a few, other neighbors).

    For a detailed description of the SAV voting system which is the base of
    this centrality index, and a study on its properties, see [1]_ and

def pairwise_centrality(G):
    """Rank nodes using the Condorcet-consistent voting rule due to A. Copeland.

    According to Condorcet, a candidate should win an election whenever it is
    preferred to each other candidate by a majority of voters in direct
    comparison. Although this is a very reasonable criterion, it doesn't tell us
    what to do when such a candidate doesn't exist (which happens most of the
    time). Arthur Copeland (1951) described a method which selects the Condorcet
    -winner whenever it exists, but chooses a candidate which is close to being
    a Condorcet winner otherwise.

    This centrality index is based on Copeland's method. Each node is compared
    with every other node in direct comparison. Say nodes A and B are compared.
    If there are more nodes strictly closer to A than to B, A receives one point
    (wins the pairwise comparison), and B loses one point. The same holds vice
    versa when B wins the pairwise comparison. If A and B are tied (neither A
    nor B wins), both receive no points. The Copeland centrality index is
    achieved by summing up all the points from all comparisons.

    The pairwise centrality index was introduced in [1]_ . Although the Copeland
    voting method is mostly known under Copeland's name, it dates back at least
    to Llull (1299). See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copeland%27s_method

def borda_centrality(G):
    """Rank nodes using Borda's voting rule.

    According to Borda voting, each voter V assigns (m-1) points to the best
    candidate in V's perspective, (m-2) to the second best, and so on. Thereby,
    m is the total number of candidates. In other words, V assigns 1 point to a
    candidate X for every candidate X beats. Assigned points from all voters are
    summed up. The candidate with the most total points wins.

    This function applies a variant of this Borda rule to networks. A voter node
    prefers candidate nodes which are closer to him/her. Due to the many ties
    (nodes at same distance), in this function a voter assigns one point to a
    candidate X for every candidate X beats, and subtracts one point from X for
    every candidate X is beaten by. This version of Borda was proposed e.g. in
    [2]_ and applied to networks in [1]_.

    """Select a set of influential nodes using Single Transferable Vote (STV).

    Single transferable vote (STV) follows the idea that a committee should be
    representative for the set of voters. The key idea is that each of X
    committee members should be supported by strictly more than the 1/(X+1)
    fraction of the voters (in fact, N/(X+1) + 1; the droop quota). For X = 2 it
    simply means that to be elected one needs strictly more than half of all
    voters' support. For X = 2 members, each member should be supported by
    strictly more than 1/3 of the voters. This way, even the combined support of
    all non-elected candidates is less than the support of each elected
    candidate. This goes on for larger X, too.

    Since usually there are no X candidates which reach the quota N/(X+1) + 1,
    STV repeats the following until X candidates are elected. If no candidate
    reaches the quota, remove the worst candidate from the election. Everyone
    who voted for this candidate now votes for their second-most preferred
    candidate. If a candidate reaches the quota, elect the candidate C with the
    most support among the voters. The excess to the quota of C is then
    distributed among the voters for C, so that they can still vote for their
    second-most preferred candidate with a reduced voting ability.

    This function computes the STV winners of a network. Nodes prefer candidates
    more the closer they are (shortest-path distance). This method has been
    proposed for networks in [1]_ (although this implementation is slightly
    different as it doesn't involve nondeterminsm). For more information on STV,
    we refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote

    Voting (SPAV).

    Sequential proportional centrality (introduced in [2]_ and based on the
    framework in [3]_ ) lets each node vote on the centrality of its neighbors
    in multiple rounds. In each round, the node with the highest voting score is
    elected where each node contributes the same points to each of its
    neighbors. Thereby, whenever a node is elected, all neighbors' voting
    ability is reduced so that in the next round they contribute less points to
    their neighbors (similar to VoteRank [4]_). By how far the voting ability is
    reduced depends on the reduction_fn, which maps an integer (how many nodes
    from the neighborhood of a "voter" are already selected) to a real number
    (voting ability). By default, reduction_fn(0) = 1, reduction_fn(1) = 1/2,
    reduction_fn(2) = 1/3, etc., is used.
