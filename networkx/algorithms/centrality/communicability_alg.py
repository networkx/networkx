    Notes
    -----
    Let `G=(V,E)` be a simple undirected graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges,
    and `A` denote the adjacency matrix of `G`.

    Let `G(r)=(V,E(r))` be the graph resulting from
    removing all edges connected to node `r` but not the node itself.

    The adjacency matrix for `G(r)` is `A+E(r)`,  where `E(r)` has nonzeros
    only in row and column `r`.

    The communicability betweenness of a node `r`  is [1]_

    .. math::
         \omega_{r} = \frac{1}{C}\sum_{p}\sum_{q}\frac{G_{prq}}{G_{pq}},
         p\neq q, q\neq r,

    where
    `G_{prq}=(e^{A}_{pq} - (e^{A+E(r)})_{pq}`  is the number of walks
    involving node r,
    `G_{pq}=(e^{A})_{pq}` is the number of closed walks starting
    at node `p` and ending at node `q`,
    and `C=(n-1)^{2}-(n-1)` is a normalization factor equal to the
    number of terms in the sum.

    The resulting `\omega_{r}` takes values between zero and one.
    The lower bound cannot be attained for a connected
    graph, and the upper bound is attained in the star graph.
