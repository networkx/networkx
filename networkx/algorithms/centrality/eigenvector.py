    """Compute the eigenvector centrality for the graph G.

    Eigenvector centrality computes the centrality for a node based on the
    centrality of its neighbors. The eigenvector centrality for node `i` is

    .. math::

        \mathbf{Ax} = \lambda \mathbf{x}

    where `A` is the adjacency matrix of the graph G with eigenvalue `\lambda`.
    By virtue of the Perron–Frobenius theorem, there is a unique and positive
    solution if `\lambda` is the largest eigenvalue associated with the
    eigenvector of the adjacency matrix `A` ([2]_).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A networkx graph

    max_iter : integer, optional
      Maximum number of iterations in power method.

    tol : float, optional
      Error tolerance used to check convergence in power method iteration.

    nstart : dictionary, optional
      Starting value of eigenvector iteration for each node.

    weight : None or string, optional
      If None, all edge weights are considered equal.
      Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.

    Returns
    -------
    nodes : dictionary
       Dictionary of nodes with eigenvector centrality as the value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)
    >>> centrality = nx.eigenvector_centrality(G)
    >>> print(['%s %0.2f'%(node,centrality[node]) for node in centrality])
    ['0 0.37', '1 0.60', '2 0.60', '3 0.37']

    Notes
    ------
    The measure was introduced by [1]_.

    The eigenvector calculation is done by the power iteration method and has
    no guarantee of convergence. The iteration will stop after ``max_iter``
    iterations or an error tolerance of ``number_of_nodes(G)*tol`` has been
    reached.

    For directed graphs this is "left" eigenvector centrality which corresponds
    to the in-edges in the graph. For out-edges eigenvector centrality
    first reverse the graph with ``G.reverse()``.

    Notes
    ------
    The measure was introduced by [1]_.

    This algorithm uses the SciPy sparse eigenvalue solver (ARPACK) to
    find the largest eigenvalue/eigenvector pair.

    For directed graphs this is "left" eigenvector centrality which corresponds
    to the in-edges in the graph. For out-edges eigenvector centrality
    first reverse the graph with G.reverse().
