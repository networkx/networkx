    """Compute the eigenvector centrality for the graph G.

    Eigenvector centrality computes the centrality for a node based on the
    centrality of its neighbors. The eigenvector centrality for node `i` is

    .. math::

        \mathbf{Ax} = \lambda \mathbf{x}

    where `A` is the adjacency matrix of the graph G with eigenvalue `\lambda`.
    By virtue of the Perron–Frobenius theorem, there is a unique and positive
    solution if `\lambda` is the largest eigenvalue associated with the
    eigenvector of the adjacency matrix `A` ([2]_).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A networkx graph

    max_iter : integer, optional
      Maximum number of iterations in power method.

    tol : float, optional
      Error tolerance used to check convergence in power method iteration.

    nstart : dictionary, optional
      Starting value of eigenvector iteration for each node.

    weight : None or string, optional
      If None, all edge weights are considered equal.
      Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.

    Returns
    -------
    nodes : dictionary
       Dictionary of nodes with eigenvector centrality as the value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)
    >>> centrality = nx.eigenvector_centrality(G)
    >>> print(['%s %0.2f'%(node,centrality[node]) for node in centrality])
    ['0 0.37', '1 0.60', '2 0.60', '3 0.37']

    Notes
    -----
    The measure was introduced by [1]_ and is discussed in [2]_.

    Eigenvector convergence: The power iteration method is used to compute
    the eigenvector and convergence is not guaranteed. Our method stops after
    ``max_iter`` iterations or when the vector change is below an error
    tolerance of ``number_of_nodes(G)*tol``. We actually use (A+I) rather
    than the adjacency matrix A because it shifts the spectrum to enable
    discerning the correct eigenvector even for networks with multiple
    dominant eigenvalues.

    For directed graphs this is "left" eigenvector centrality which corresponds
    to the in-edges in the graph. For out-edges eigenvector centrality
    first reverse the graph with ``G.reverse()``.

    Notes
    -----
    The measure was introduced by [1]_.

    This algorithm uses the SciPy sparse eigenvalue solver (ARPACK) to
    find the largest eigenvalue/eigenvector pair.

    For directed graphs this is "left" eigenvector centrality which corresponds
    to the in-edges in the graph. For out-edges eigenvector centrality
    first reverse the graph with G.reverse().
