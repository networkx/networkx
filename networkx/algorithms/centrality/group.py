def group_betweenness_centrality(G, C, normalized=True, weight=None):
    r"""Compute the group betweenness centrality for a group of nodes.

    Group betweenness centrality of a group of nodes $C$ is the sum of the
    fraction of all-pairs shortest paths that pass through any vertex in $C$

    .. math::

       c_B(C) =\sum_{s,t \in V-C; s<t} \frac{\sigma(s, t|C)}{\sigma(s, t)}

    where $V$ is the set of nodes, $\sigma(s, t)$ is the number of
    shortest $(s, t)$-paths, and $\sigma(s, t|C)$ is the number of
    those paths passing through some node in group $C$. Note that
    $(s, t)$ are not members of the group ($V-C$ is the set of nodes
    in $V$ that are not in $C$).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX graph.

    C : list or set
      C is a group of nodes which belong to G, for which group betweenness
      centrality is to be calculated.

    normalized : bool, optional
      If True, group betweenness is normalized by `2/((|V|-|C|)(|V|-|C|-1))`
      for graphs and `1/((|V|-|C|)(|V|-|C|-1))` for directed graphs where `|V|`
      is the number of nodes in G and `|C|` is the number of nodes in C.

    weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
      If None, all edge weights are considered equal.
      Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.

    Raises
    ------
    NodeNotFound
       If node(s) in C are not present in G.

    Returns
    -------
    betweenness : float
       Group betweenness centrality of the group C.

    See Also
    --------
    betweenness_centrality

    Notes
    -----
    The measure is described in [1]_.
    The algorithm is an extension of the one proposed by Ulrik Brandes for
    betweenness centrality of nodes. Group betweenness is also mentioned in
    his paper [2]_ along with the algorithm. The importance of the measure is
    discussed in [3]_.

    The number of nodes in the group must be a maximum of n - 2 where `n`
    is the total number of nodes in the graph.

    For weighted graphs the edge weights must be greater than zero.
    Zero edge weights can produce an infinite number of equal length
    paths between pairs of nodes.

def group_closeness_centrality(G, S, weight=None):
    r"""Compute the group closeness centrality for a group of nodes.

    Group closeness centrality of a group of nodes $S$ is a measure
    of how close the group is to the other nodes in the graph.

    .. math::

       c_{close}(S) = \frac{|V-S|}{\sum_{v \in V-S} d_{S, v}}

       d_{S, v} = min_{u \in S} (d_{u, v})

    where $V$ is the set of nodes, $d_{S, v}$ is the distance of
    the group $S$ from $v$ defined as above. ($V-S$ is the set of nodes
    in $V$ that are not in $S$).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
       A NetworkX graph.

    S : list or set
       S is a group of nodes which belong to G, for which group closeness
       centrality is to be calculated.

    weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
       If None, all edge weights are considered equal.
       Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.

    Raises
    ------
    NodeNotFound
       If node(s) in S are not present in G.

    Returns
    -------
    closeness : float
       Group closeness centrality of the group S.

    See Also
    --------
    closeness_centrality

    Notes
    -----
    The measure was introduced in [1]_.
    The formula implemented here is described in [2]_.

    Higher values of closeness indicate greater centrality.

    It is assumed that 1 / 0 is 0 (required in the case of directed graphs,
    or when a shortest path length is 0).

    The number of nodes in the group must be a maximum of n - 1 where `n`
    is the total number of nodes in the graph.

    For directed graphs, the incoming distance is utilized here. To use the
    outward distance, act on `G.reverse()`.

    For weighted graphs the edge weights must be greater than zero.
    Zero edge weights can produce an infinite number of equal length
    paths between pairs of nodes.
