    The degree centrality for a node v is the fraction of nodes it

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A networkx graph 

    Returns
    -------
    nodes : dictionary
       Dictionary of nodes with degree centrality as the value.

    Notes

    The degree centrality values are normalized by dividing by the maximum 
    possible degree in a simple graph n-1 where n is the number of nodes in G.

    For multigraphs or graphs with self loops the maximum degree might
    be higher than n-1 and values of degree centrality greater than 1
    are possible.
