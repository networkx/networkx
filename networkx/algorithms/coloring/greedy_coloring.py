    """Colors the nodes of a graph using a greedy graph coloring algorithm
    and, optionally, a subsequent optimisation algorithm based on tabu search.
    The method assigns a color to each vertex such that neighbouring
    vertices always have different colors. The aim is to construct a coloring
    that uses as few different colors as possible.

    The given ``strategy`` determines the order that nodes are to be colored
    by the $O(n+m)$ "greedy algorithm" for graph coloring. If the ``interchange``
    operator is used, this ordering is adjusted before the application of the
    greedy algorithm in an attempt to reduce the resultant number of colors.
    Note that ``interchange`` cannot be used with the strategies
    ``'saturation_largest_first'``, ``'DSATUR'`` or ``'rlf'``.

    If the strategies ``'saturation_largest_first'``, ``'DSATUR'`` or ``'rlf'``
    are used, the algorithm is exact for bipartite, cycle, and wheel graphs
    (that is, solutions with the minimum number of colors are guaranteed).

    On production of a solution via the greedy algorithm, an optional optimization
    process can also be employed that seeks to further reduce the number of colors
    being used. This algorithm is based on tabu search.

    The greedy strategies are described in more detail in [1]_, [2]_, [3]_, and [4]_.
    The tabu search algorithm is described in [4]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    strategy : string or function(G, colors), optional (default='largest_first')
       A function (or string representing a function) that provides
       an ordering of the vertices that is then passed to the
       greedy algorithm. ``G`` is the graph. The function must
       return an iterable over all nodes in ``G``.

       If ``strategy`` is a string, it must be one of the following,
       each of which represents one of the built-in strategy functions.

       * ``'largest_first'``
       * ``'random_sequential'``
       * ``'smallest_last'``
       * ``'independent_set'``
       * ``'connected_sequential_bfs'``
       * ``'connected_sequential_dfs'``
       * ``'connected_sequential'`` (alias for the previous strategy)
       * ``'saturation_largest_first'``
       * ``'DSATUR'`` (alias for the previous strategy)
       * ``'rlf'``

    interchange: bool
       Will use the color interchange algorithm described by [3]_ if set
       to ``True``.

       Note that ``saturation_largest_first``, ``independent_set``, and ``rlf``
       do not work with interchange.

    tabu : integer, optional (default=0)
       Runs a tabu search algorithm for the specified number of iterations.
       The algorithm takes a proper coloring formed by the chosen strategy
       above and attempts to reduce the number of colors being used.
       The method is based on an iterated version of PartialCol, described in
       [4]_. Given a proper $k$-coloring, the algorithm first "uncolors"
       all vertices in a randomly chosen color class. The PartialCol
       algorithm (based on tabu search) is then executed, which attempts to
       reduce the cardinality of the set of uncolored vertices.
       If this cardinality is reduced to zero, $k$ is decremented
       by one, and the process is repeated. The algorithm terminates once the
       iteration limit is exceeded. Fewer colors (but longer run times)
       occur with larger iteration limits. Given a graph with $n$ vertices,
       $m$ edges, and $k$ colors, each iteration of PartialCol has complexity
       $O(nk + m)$. The process also uses $O(nk + m)$ memory.

    Returns
    -------
    A dictionary with keys representing nodes and values representing the
    corresponding coloring.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> d = nx.coloring.greedy_color(G, strategy="largest_first")
    >>> d in [{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 0}]
    True

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the use of ``strategy='rlf'`` yields solutions using fewer colors
    than the other methods, though it is computationally more expensive. If
    expense is an issue, then ``'saturation_largest_first'`` is a cheaper alternative
    that also offers high quality solutions in most cases.

    The subseuent use of tabu search usually allows solutions with fewer colors to
    be identified. Larger values for ``tabusearch`` yield better results but also
    longer run times.

    Further information on the relative performance of these algorithms can be found
    in [4]_.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXPointlessConcept
        If ``strategy`` is ``saturation_largest_first``, ``rlf``, or
        ``independent_set``, and ``interchange`` is ``True``.

    NetworkXError
        If an invalid string for ``strategy`` is used.
