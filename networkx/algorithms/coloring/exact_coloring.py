def exact_color(graph: nx.Graph) -> Dict[T, int]:
    """Color a graph using the minimum number of colors.

    Finds an exact coloring of the given graph.
    If the graph is not connected, the algorithm recursively colors
    all connected components separately.

    A valid coloring maps each node to a color in a way so that adjacent nodes
    are mapped to different colors.
    Exact coloring is a valid coloring that uses minimum number of
    unique colors. The problem is NP-Complete thus the algorithm relies on
    backtracking approach to find the coloring.

    The algorithm is known as backGCP, described in [1]_.

    The following implementation has a custom-engineered heuristic, optimized
    for random graphs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    Returns
    ----------
    Dict[Any, int]
        Mapping between graph nodes and integers representing colors

    Examples
    ----------
    >>> graph = nx.generators.small.petersen_graph()
    >>> coloring = nx.algorithms.coloring.exact_coloring.exact_color(graph)
    >>> coloring
    {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 1, 8: 0, 6: 2, 9: 0, 7: 2}
    >>> chromatic_number = len(set(coloring.values()))
    >>> chromatic_number
