def communicability(G):
    r"""Returns communicability between all pairs of nodes in G.

    The communicability between pairs of nodes in G is the sum of
    closed walks of different lengths starting at node u and ending at node v.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G: graph

    Returns
    -------
    comm: dictionary of dictionaries
        Dictionary of dictionaries keyed by nodes with communicability
        as the value.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
       If the graph is not undirected and simple.

    --------
    communicability_exp:
       Communicability between all pairs of nodes in G  using spectral
       decomposition.
    communicability_betweenness_centrality:
       Communicability betweeness centrality for each node in G.

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm uses a spectral decomposition of the adjacency matrix.
    Let G=(V,E) be a simple undirected graph.  Using the connection between
    the powers  of the adjacency matrix and the number of walks in the graph,
    the communicability  between nodes `u` and `v` based on the graph spectrum
    is [1]_

    .. math::
        C(u,v)=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\phi_{j}(u)\phi_{j}(v)e^{\lambda_{j}},

    where `\phi_{j}(u)` is the `u\rm{th}` element of the `j\rm{th}` orthonormal
    eigenvector of the adjacency matrix associated with the eigenvalue
    `\lambda_{j}`.
