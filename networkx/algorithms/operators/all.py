    Parameters
    ----------
    graphs : list of graphs
       List of NetworkX graphs

    rename : bool , default=(None, None)
       Node names of G and H can be changed by specifying the tuple
       rename=('G-','H-') (for example).  Node "u" in G is then renamed
       "G-u" and "v" in H is renamed "H-v".

    name : string
       Specify the name for the union graph@not_implemnted_for('direct

    Returns
    -------
    U : a graph with the same type as the first graph in list

    Notes
    -----
    To force a disjoint union with node relabeling, use
    disjoint_union_all(G,H) or convert_node_labels_to integers().

    Graph, edge, and node attributes are propagated to the union graph.
    If a graph attribute is present in multiple graphs, then the value
    from the last graph in the list with that attribute is used.
