    -----
    To obtain a list of all cliques, use

    keeping current candidate node lists in memory during its search.

    The implementation is adapted from the algorithm by Zhang, et
    al. (2005) [1]_ to output all cliques discovered.

    This algorithm ignores self-loops and parallel edges, since cliques

    For each node *v*, a *maximal clique for v* is a largest complete
    subgraph containing *v*. The largest maximal clique is sometimes
    called the *maximum clique*.

    This function returns an iterator over cliques, each of which is a
    list of nodes. It is an iterative implementation, so should not
    suffer from recursion depth issues.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        An undirected graph.

    Returns
    -------
    iterator
        An iterator over maximal cliques, each of which is a list of

    -----
    To obtain a list of all maximal cliques, use

    the length of this list can be exponential in the number of nodes in

    This implementation is based on the algorithm published by Bron and
    Kerbosch (1973) [1]_, as adapted by Tomita, Tanaka and Takahashi
    (2006) [2]_ and discussed in Cazals and Karande (2008) [3]_. It
    essentially unrolls the recursion used in the references to avoid
    issues of recursion stack depth (for a recursive implementation, see
    :func:`find_cliques_recursive`).

    This algorithm ignores self-loops and parallel edges, since cliques
    are not conventionally defined with such edges.
