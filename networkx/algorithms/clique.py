Cliques

Find and manipulate cliques of graphs.

Note that finding the largest clique of a graph has been
shown to be an NP-complete problem; the algorithms here
could take a long time to run.

    """Returns all cliques in an undirected graph.

    This method returns cliques of size (cardinality)
    k = 1, 2, 3, ..., maxDegree - 1.

    Where maxDegree is the maximal degree of any node in the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G: undirected graph

    Returns
    -------
    generator of lists: generator of list for each clique.

    Notes
    -----
    To obtain a list of all cliques, use
    :samp:`list(enumerate_all_cliques(G))`.

    Based on the algorithm published by Zhang et al. (2005) [1]_
    and adapted to output all cliques discovered.

    This algorithm is not applicable on directed graphs.

    This algorithm ignores self-loops and parallel edges as
    clique is not conventionally defined with such edges.

    There are often many cliques in graphs.
    This algorithm however, hopefully, does not run out of memory
    since it only keeps candidate sublists in memory and
    continuously removes exhausted sublists.
