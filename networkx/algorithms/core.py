Find the k-cores of a graph.

The k-core is found by recursively pruning nodes with degrees less than k.

See the following references for details:

An O(m) Algorithm for Cores Decomposition of Networks

Generalized Cores
Vladimir Batagelj and Matjaz Zaversnik, 2002.
https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0202039

For directed graphs a more general notion is that of D-cores which
looks at (k, l) restrictions on (in, out) degree. The (k, k) D-core
is the k-core.
