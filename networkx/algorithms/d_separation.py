"""
Algorithm for testing d-separation in DAGs.

*d-separation* is a test for conditional independence in probability
distributions that can be factorized using DAGs.  It is a purely
graphical test that uses the underlying graph and makes no reference
to the actual distribution parameters.  See [1]_ for a formal
definition.

To understand d-separation intuitively, consider the following example:

For a pair of two nodes, u and v, all paths are considered open initially, unless
they contain a collider along the path. d-separation is concerned with blocking all
paths between these u and v. A path is considered blocked by the
separating set if all open paths contain some variable in the d-separating
set that is not a collider, or the descendant of a collider.

A collider is a triplet of variables along a path that is like the following:
``... u -> c <- v ...``), where 'c' is a common child of 'u' and 'v'. If the
d-separating set contains a collider, or a descendant of a collider, then the
path through the collider is opened. 

The implementation is based on the conceptually simple linear time
algorithm presented in [2]_.  Refer to [3]_, [4]_ for a couple of
alternative algorithms.


Examples
--------

>>>
>>> # HMM graph with five states and observation nodes
... g = nx.DiGraph()
>>> g.add_edges_from(
...     [
...         ("S1", "S2"),
...         ("S2", "S3"),
...         ("S3", "S4"),
...         ("S4", "S5"),
...         ("S1", "O1"),
...         ("S2", "O2"),
...         ("S3", "O3"),
...         ("S4", "O4"),
...         ("S5", "O5"),
...     ]
... )
>>>
>>> # states/obs before 'S3' are d-separated from states/obs after 'S3'
... nx.d_separated(g, {"S1", "S2", "O1", "O2"}, {"S4", "S5", "O4", "O5"}, {"S3"})
True

    This function only finds ``a`` minimal d-separator. It does not guarantee
    uniqueness, since in a DAG there may be more than one minimal d-separator
    between two nodes.

    Moreover, this only checks for minimal separators between two nodes, not
    two sets. Finding minimal d-separators between two sets of nodes is not
    supported.

    Uses the algorithm presented in [1]_. The complexity of the algorithm
    is :math:`O(|E_{An}^m|)`, where :math:`E_{An}^m` stands for the
    number of edges in the moralized graph of the sub-graph consisting

    This function only works on verifying a d-separating set is minimal

    two sets of nodes is not supported.

    Uses the algorithm 2 presented in [1]_. The complexity of the algorithm

    number of edges in the moralized graph of the sub-graph consisting
    of only the ancestors of ``u`` and ``v``.

    The algorithm works by constructing the moral graph consisting of just
    the ancestors of ``u`` and ``v``. First, it performs BFS on the moral graph
    starting from ``u`` and marking any nodes it encounters that is part of
    the separating set, ``z``. If a node is marked, then it does not continue
    along that path. Then it performs BFS with markings is repeated on the
    moral graph starting from ``v``. If at any stage, any node in ``z`` is
    not marked, then ``z`` is considered not minimal. If the end of the algorithm
    is reached, then ``z`` is minimal.
