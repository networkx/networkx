    A graph is chordal if every cycle of length at least 4 has a chord

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX graph.

    Returns
    -------
    chordal : bool
      True if G is a chordal graph and False otherwise.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        The algorithm does not support DiGraph, MultiGraph and MultiDiGraph.
        If the input graph is an instance of one of these classes, a
        :exc:`NetworkXError` is raised.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import networkx as nx

    Notes
    -----
    The routine tries to go through every node following maximum cardinality
    search. It returns False when it finds that the separator for any node
    is not a clique.  Based on the algorithms in [1]_.
