    """Checks whether G is a chordal graph.

    A graph is chordal if every cycle of length at least 4 has a chord
    (an edge joining two nodes not adjacent in the cycle).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX graph.

    Returns
    -------
    chordal : bool
      True if G is a chordal graph and False otherwise.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        The algorithm does not support DiGraph, MultiGraph and MultiDiGraph.
        If the input graph is an instance of one of these classes, a
        :exc:`NetworkXError` is raised.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> e=[(1,2),(1,3),(2,3),(2,4),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6)]
    >>> G=nx.Graph(e)
    >>> nx.is_chordal(G)
    True

    Notes
    -----
    The routine tries to go through every node following maximum cardinality
    search. It returns False when it finds that the separator for any node
    is not a clique.  Based on the algorithms in [1]_.

def find_induced_nodes(G, s, t, treewidth_bound=sys.maxsize):

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A chordal NetworkX graph
    s : node
        Source node to look for induced nodes
    t : node
        Destination node to look for induced nodes

    Examples
    --------

    Notes
    -----
    G must be a chordal graph and (s,t) an edge that is not in G.

    If a treewidth_bound is provided, the search for induced nodes will end
    as soon as the treewidth_bound is exceeded.

    The algorithm is inspired by Algorithm 4 in [1]_.
    A formal definition of induced node can also be found on that reference.
