Hierarchy Coordinates
========================
Functions to calculate hierarchy coordinates for directed networks.

Hierarchy coordinates consist of treeness, feedforwardness, and orderability,
which collectively create a 'hierarchy morphospace' classifying all network
structures. In loose terms, treeness describes how consistently nodes higher
on the hierarchy (maximal nodes) branch into more nodes, while feedforwardness
considers the extent information passes vertically (vs horizontally) within
a hierarchy, and orderability considers what fraction of the network is
vertically hierarchical.

Originally from [1]_, adapted implementation accommodates weighted network.

    The feedforwardness heierarchy coordinate represents the extent information
    passes vertically, as opposed to horizontally, within a hierarchy. That is,
    how much does information pass through unreciprocated connections versus how
    much through cyclic (reciprocated) connections.

    Based on a weighted sum which considers how much each path from every
    maximal node to every minimal node traverses through cyclic (flat hierarchy)
    components. As this is performed over a DAG whose node weights represent the
    number of cyclic nodes so condensed, the ratio of nodes to their total
    weight in a given path yields precisely this measure. Feedforwardness is
    then given by the mean of this ratio for all paths on a given layer, and
    then summing over all layers pruned through repeated removal of maximal
    nodes.


    More formally, total feedfowardness is given by
    .. math:: F(G) = \frac{g(G_C) + \sum_{k < L(G_C)} g(G_k)}{|\prod_{M \mu}(G_c)| + \sum_{k < L_{G_C}} |\prod_{M \mu} (G_k)|}

    set of paths from maximal to minimal nodes, :math:`L_{G_C}` is the set of layers produced by removing maximal nodes,
    and :math:`g(G_k) = \sum_{\pi_i \in \prod_{M \mu}(G_k)} F(\pi_i)` where
    :math:`F(\pi_k) = \frac{|v(\pi_k)|}{\sum_{v_i \in v(\pi_k)} \alpha_i}`, with :math:`v_k` and :math:`\alpha_k` being
    the k-ths node and its weight, respectively.

    Parameters
