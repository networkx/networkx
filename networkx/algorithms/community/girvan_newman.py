    r"""Finds communities in graph using the Girvan-Newman Algorithm[1]_. The 
    community structure finding algorithm follows this steps:
    1.- Calculate the betweenness for all the edges
    2.- Find the edge with the highest score and remove it from the network
    3.- Recalculate the betweenness
    4.- Repeat from 2 until there are no more edges
    
    The result is a dendogram where the leaves are the individual nodes.

    The algorithm works on undirected networks with only a single node type and 
    does not take it account edge weights.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      An undirected NetworkX graph
    
    preserve_original : bool, optional (default=True)
      The algorithm is divisive and the edges of the graph are going to be 
      deleted. If True makes a copy of the original graph so it is not 
      destroyed. 
    
    Returns
    -------
    nodes : dictionary
    Dictionary of nodes with betweenness centrality as the value.
