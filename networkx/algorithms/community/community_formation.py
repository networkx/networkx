Implementation of the Social Aware Assignment of Passengers in Ridesharing, also known as coalition
formation or graph partitioning in the literature

The social aware assignment problem belongs to the field of community formation, which is an important
research branch within multiagent systems. It analyses the outcome that results
when a set of agents is partitioned into communities.

Actually, Match_And_Merge model is a special case of simple Additively Separable Hedonic Games (ASHGs).

Which was described in the article:
Levinger C., Hazon N., Azaria A. Social Aware Assignment of Passengers in Ridesharing. - 2022,
Implementation of match_and_merge
algorithm is based on the pseudocode from the article
which is implemented by Victor Kushnir (@VictoKu1).

    An approximation algorithm for any k ≥ 3, provides a solution for the social aware
    assignment problem with a ratio of 1/(k-1).

    Social aware assignment definition:

    Given a number k and an undirected friendship graph G = (V, E) where
    (v_i , v_j) ∈ E if v_i and v_j are connected.
    The goal is to find an assignment P, which is a partition of the set V , such that ∀S ∈ P,
    |S|≤ k and the value of P, V_P = |{(v_i , v_j) ∈ E: ∃S ∈ P
    where v_i ∈ S and v_j ∈ S}| is maximized.

    As described in the article under the section "Algorithm 1: Match and Merge".

    The article:

    Levinger C., Hazon N., Azaria A. Social Aware Assignment of Passengers in Ridesharing. - 2022,

    Function receives a graph G and a number k, and returns a partition P of G of all matched sets,
    so for ∀S ∈ P,b|S|≤ k, and the value of P,
    V_P = |{(v_i , v_j) ∈ E: ∃S ∈ P where v_i ∈ S and v_j ∈ S}| is maximized.

    The algorithm consists of k - 1 rounds. Each round is composed of a matching phase
    followed by a merging phase.

    Specifically, in round l MnM computes a maximum matching, M_l ⊆ E_l , for G_l (where G_1 = G).
    In the merging phase, MnM creates a graph G_(l+1) that includes a unified
    node for each pair of matched nodes.
    G_(l+1) also includes all unmatched nodes, along with their edges to the unified nodes.
    Clearly, each node in V_l is composed of up-to l nodes from V_1.
    Finally, MnM returns the partition, P, of all the matched sets in a way that ∀S ∈ P,
    |S|≤ k, and the value of P, V_P = |{(v_i , v_j) ∈ E: ∃S ∈ P where v_i ∈ S and v_j ∈ S}| is maximized.

    :param G: Graph
    :param k: Number of passengers
    :return: A partition P of G of all matched sets so ∀S ∈ P, |S|≤ k and the value of P,
    V_P = |{(v_i , v_j) ∈ E: ∃S ∈ P where v_i ∈ S and v_j ∈ S}| is maximized.
