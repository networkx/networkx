"""
This module implements useful functions to prepare data for
drawing dendrograms of community detections performed by the
Girvan-Newman algorithm on graphs.

The Girvan–Newman algorithm detects communities by progressively removing
edges from the original graph. During the procedure the graph is broken
down into pieces and the tightly knit community structure is exposed, so
the result can be depicted as a dendrogram.
In particular, the main goal of this module is to get the result of the
`girvan_newman` function applied to a given graph and to encode it into
a matrix named "agglomerative matrix". Then, this matrix can be given in
input to the `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram` function to plot a
dendrogram.

You can look at some other examples on
[github](https://github.com/FrancescoBonacina/dendrogram_girvan-newman).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        `G` must meet 2 conditions
        1. `G` must contain only one connected component
        2. The nodes must be integers from 0 to (number_of_nodes - 1)

    Returns
    -------
    list
        List of lists of sets of nodes in `G`. Each set of nodes
        is a community, each list is a sequence of communities at a
        particular level of the algorithm. The sets in each list
        will be sorted according to the smallest node they contain
        (e.g., [{0}, {4}, {1, 3}, {2, 6, 7}, {5}]
        will be sorted to [{0}, {1, 3}, {2, 6, 7}, {4}, {5}]).

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If `G` does not meet the conditions:
        1. `G` must contain only one connected componet

    Example

    Notes
    -----
    The Girvan--Newman algorithm detects communities by progressively
    removing edges from the original graph. The algorithm removes the
    "most valuable" edge, traditionally the edge with the highest
    betweenness centrality, at each step. As the graph breaks down into
    pieces, the tightly knit community structure is exposed and the
    result can be depicted as a dendrogram.

def agglomerative_matrix(G, list_partitions):
    """Perform hierarchical/agglomerative clustering.

    Creates the "agglomerative matrix" of a graph from the community detection
    performed with the Girvan-Newman algorithm.
    The Girvan–Newman algorithm detects communities by progressively removing
    edges from the original graph. The algorithm removes the "most valuable"
    edge, traditionally the edge with the highest betweenness centrality, at
    each step. As the graph breaks down into pieces, the tightly knit community
    structure is exposed and the result can be depicted as a dendrogram.
    The Girvan_Newman algorithm detects (number_nodes - 1) partitions: in
    particular the first partition will contain 2 communities while in the last
    one each node will be a different community (so, there will be
    'number_nodes' different communities). The idea is to start from the last
    partition and retrace the path that unites the communities to the first
    partition. That is to reconstruct the process of agglomeration of the
    communities. The "agglomerative matrix" will contain this information.

    This is a matrix of the same type of the one created by the
    `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` function.

    The purpose of the `agglomerative_matrix` function is to create a
    matrix we can use to plot a dendrogram with
    `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram`.

    The "agglomerative matrix" (AM) is a numpy.ndarray where each row
    corresponds to a node.  The 4 columns contain the following information:

    - AM[i,0] = integer, label of the existing community A. The community
      A will be merge to the existing community B to form the ith new community.
    - AM[i,1] = integer, label of the existing community B (With AM[i,0] < AM[i,1]).
    - AM[i,2] = integer, distance of the ith new community from the level zero.
    - AM[i,3] = integer, number of nodes in the ith new community.

    A community with an index less than 'number_nodes' corresponds to one
    which contains only that single node. A community with an index
    belonging to [number_nodes, 2*number_nodes - 3] corresponds to one of
    the new communities formed in the agglomeration process.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        `G` must meet 2 conditions:
        1. `G` must contain only one connected componet
        2. The nodes must be integers from 0 to (number_of_nodes - 1)

    list_partitions : list
        List of (number_nodes -1) lists got using `girvan_newman_partitions`.
        Each list contains the information about the partition of that level.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        The "agglomerative matrix" (AM) is a numpy.ndarray with shape
        (number_nodes -1)x4. The ith row contains information about the new
        community created at that level by merging 2 existing communities.
        So the first row contains information about the first new community,
        which will contain 2 nodes, while the last row contains information
        about the 2 communities which merge to generate the entire graph
        (with 'number_nodes' nodes).

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If `G` does not meet the conditions:
        1. `G` must contain inly one connected componet

def distance_of_partition(agglomerative_matrix, n_communities):
    """Returns the distance of the partition from the ground level.

    The partition considered is the one which splits the graph into
    `n_communities` different communities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    agglomerative_matrix: numpy.ndarray
        Matrix which encodes the hierarchical clustering to render as
        a dendrogram. The hierarchical clustering is detected using the
        Girvan-Newman algorithm. See the `agglomerative_matrix` function
        for more information on the format of `agglomerative_matrix`.

    n_comunities: integer
        The number of communities into which the partition we are
        interested in is split.

    Returns
    -------
    integer
        Distance of the partition we are interested in from the ground level.
        Which is the distance from the hierarchy level where all nodes are
        disconnected.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If n_communities does not belong to [1, number_nodes]

    Example
    -------
    To get the distance of the partition with 2 communities from the
    ground level

    >>> G = nx.path_graph(6)
    >>> partitions = girvan_newman_partitions(G)
    >>> agglomerative_mat = agglomerative_matrix(G, partitions)
    >>> n_communities = 2
    >>> distance_of_partition(agglomerative_mat, n_communities)
    3

    To plot the dendrogram highlighting the partition which splits the graph
    into 2 communities

    >>> from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram
    >>> dendro_2comm = dendrogram(agglomerative_mat, color_threshold=3)
