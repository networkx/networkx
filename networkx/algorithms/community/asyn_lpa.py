def asyn_lpa_communities(G, weight=None):
    """
    Asynchronous label propagation algorithm for community detection described
    on [1]_. The algorithm is probabilistic and the found communities may
    vary on different executions.

    The algorithm follows these steps:

    1. Initialize the labels at all nodes in the network giving them unique
    identifiers.
    2. Set _t=1_.
    3. Arrange the nodes in the network in a random order and set it to _X_.
    4. For each _x_ in _X_ chosen in that specific order, get the label
    occurring with the highest frecuency among neighbors. Ties are broken
    uniformly randomly.
    5. If every node has a label that the maximun number of their neighbors
    have, then stop the algorithm. Else set _t = t+1_ and got to (3).

    Modified to be able to take into account the edge weights when assigning
    the labels to one node.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        Network to be processed

    weight : string
        If the graph is weighted, the edge parameter representing the weight.
        If left to None edge weights are not taken into account.

    Returns
    -------
    communities : list
        List of communities (sets)
        
    Notes
    ------
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
