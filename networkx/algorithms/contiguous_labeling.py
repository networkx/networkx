An Implementation of the Contiguous Oriented Labeling Algorithm
Based on:
"Fair and Efficient Cake Division with Connected Pieces" by Xiaohui Bei and Warut Suksompong
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.14129.pdf

Programmer: Ghia sarhan
Date: 2025-05-16

This module provides functions to:
1. Determine if a graph is bridgeless or almost bridgeless
2. Construct a contiguous oriented labeling for almost bridgeless graphs

The output format of contiguous_oriented_labeling is:
   (label, i_minus, i_plus)
Where:
- 'label' is an integer index starting from 1
- 'i_minus' (or i⁻) is the source vertex of a directed edge
- 'i_plus' (or i⁺) is the target vertex of a directed edge

This corresponds to the contiguous oriented labeling definition from the paper:
   For each edge i, it is directed from vertex i⁻ to i⁺.
   You can transform the output tuples into readable format like:
       f"Edge {label}: {i_minus}⁻ → {i_plus}⁺"

    Create a contiguous oriented labeling for an almost bridgeless graph.

    A contiguous oriented labeling is an ordering of edges with orientation such that
    for any prefix of edges, they form a connected subgraph, and for any suffix of
    edges, they also form a connected subgraph with specific connectivity conditions.

    The algorithm works by:

    2. Iteratively adding new ears that connect to previously added edges
    3. Maintaining the contiguous property throughout the construction
