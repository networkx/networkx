def get_initial_maps_and_height(T, root):
    """Get the initial maps and height used by the rooted tree isomorphism alg.

    Define and return the following maps: LEVELS, VALUES, PARENTHOOD and
    CHILDREN. Also return the rooted tree's height.

    For the LEVELS map. Let h be the height of the tree. The amount of
    levels a tree has is equal to its height. If a vertex v is on the i-th
    level, then its childs are on the (i-1)-th level. Thus, by definition, the
    only vertex in the h-th level is the root of the tree and the only vertices
    on the level 0 are leaves. Define a LEVELS map such that, for each i in
    {0,...,h}, LEVELS(i) is the set of vertices found on the i-th level of T.

    For the VALUES map. A value of a vertex corresponds to the structure it has
    on the rooted tree. Informally, the structure of a vertex can be thought as
    the structure or "form" the sub-tree rooted on v has. Define the initial
    values of the VALUES map such that, for every vertex v in the rooted tree,
    if v is a leaf then v's initial value is 0, otherwise its defined as -1.

    The PARENTHOOD map is the parent-child relationship obtained when traversing
    the rooted tree, in this case the algorithm used is BFS.

    For the CHILDREN map. Defines a map CHILDREN where CHILDREN(v) is the
    ordered list of children of v in the rooted tree. This map determines who
    are the parents of the leaves found on the 0-th level.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T : NetworkX Graph
        The rooted tree.

    root : node
        The root of the tree.

    Returns
    -------
    LEVELS : dict of int: set of nodes
        A LEVELS map such that, for each i in {0,...,h}, LEVELS(i) is the set of
        vertices found on the i-th level of T.

    VALUES : dict of node: int
        A VALUES map such that, for each vertex v in the rooted tree, if v is a
        leaf then v's initial value is 0, otherwise its defined as -1.

    CHILDREN : dict of node: list of nodes
        A CHILDREN map such that CHILDREN(v) is the ordered list of children
        of v in the rooted tree. This map determines who are the parents of the
        leaves found on the 0-th level.

    PARENTHOOD : dict of node: node
        The parenthood map of the rooted tree.
