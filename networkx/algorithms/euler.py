    """Returns ``True`` if and only if ``G`` is Eulerian.

    An graph is *Eulerian* if it has an Eulerian circuit. An *Eulerian
    circuit* is a closed walk that includes each edge of a graph exactly
    once.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
       A graph, either directed or undirected.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> nx.is_eulerian(nx.DiGraph({0: [3], 1: [2], 2: [3], 3: [0, 1]}))
    True
    >>> nx.is_eulerian(nx.complete_graph(5))
    True
    >>> nx.is_eulerian(nx.petersen_graph())
    False

    Notes
    -----
    If the graph is not connected (or not strongly connected, for
    directed graphs), this function returns ``False``.

    An *Eulerian circuit* is a closed walk that includes each edge of a

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
       A graph, either directed or undirected.

    source : node, optional
       Starting node for circuit.

    Returns
    -------
    edges : iterator
       An iterator over edges in the Eulerian circuit.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError

    To get an Eulerian circuit in an undirected graph::

        >>> list(nx.eulerian_circuit(G, source=1))
        [(1, 2), (2, 0), (0, 1)]

    To get the sequence of vertices in an Eulerian circuit::

        >>> [u for u, v in nx.eulerian_circuit(G)]
        [0, 2, 1]
