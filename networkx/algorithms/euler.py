    Notes
    -----
    Linear time algorithm, adapted from [1]_ and [3]_.
    Information about Euler paths in [2]_.
    Code for Eulerian circuit in [3]_.

    Important: In [1], Euler path is in reverse order,
    this implementation gives the path in correct order
    as in [3]_ for Eulerian_circuit. The distinction for
    directed graph is in using the in_degree neighbors, not the out
    ones. for undirected, it is using itemgetter(1) for get_vertex,
    which uses the correct vertex for this order. Also, every graph
    has an even number of odd vertices by the Handshaking Theorem [4]_.
