def find_extendability(G):
    """ Computes the extendability of a graph.

    Definition
    Graph G is $k$-extendable if and only if G has a perfect matching and every
    set of $k$ independent edges can extend to perfect matching.

    EXTENDABILITY PROBLEM
    --------------------------------------------
    Input: A graph G and a positive integer $k$.
    Output: Is G $k$-extendable?
    --------------------------------------------

    In general case the above problem is co-NP-complete([2]).
    If graph G is bipartite, then it can be decided in polynomial time([1]).

    The maximization version of the EXTENDABILITY PROBLEM asks to compute the
    maximum $k$ for which G is $k$-extendable.

    Let G be a simple, connected, undirected and bipartite graph with a perfect
    matching M and bipartition (U,V). The residual graph of G, denoted by $G_M$,
    is the graph obtained from G by directing the edges of M from V to U and the
    edges that do not belong to M from U to V.

    Lemma([1])
    Let M be a perfect matching of G. G is k-extendable if and only if its residual
    graph $G_M$ is strongly connected and there are $k$ vertex-disjoint directed
    paths between every vertex of U and every vertex of V.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph
    ----------

    Returns
    -------
    extendability: int
    -------

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
      If the graph G is of type nx.MultiGraph, nx.MultiDiGraph or nx.DiGraph.
      If the graph G is not simple.
      If the graph G is disconnected.
      If the graph G is not bipartite.
      If the graph G does not contain a perfect matching.
      If the residual graph of G is not strongly connected.
    ------

    Notes
    -----
    Time complexity: O($n^3$ $m^2$))
