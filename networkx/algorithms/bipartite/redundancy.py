def node_redundancy(G, nodes=None):
    r"""Compute bipartite node redundancy coefficient.

    The redundancy coefficient of a node `v` is the fraction of pairs of
    neighbors of `v` that are both linked to other nodes. In a one-mode
    projection these nodes would be linked together even if `v`  were
    not there.

    .. math::

        rc(v) = \frac{|\{\{u,w\} \subseteq N(v),
        \: \exists v' \neq  v,\: (v',u) \in E\:
        \mathrm{and}\: (v',w) \in E\}|}{ \frac{|N(v)|(|N(v)|-1)}{2}}

    where `N(v)` are the neighbors of `v` in `G`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A bipartite graph

    nodes : list or iterable (optional)
        Compute redundancy for these nodes. The default is all nodes in G.

    Returns
    -------
    redundancy : dictionary
        A dictionary keyed by node with the node redundancy value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from networkx.algorithms import bipartite
    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> rc = bipartite.node_redundancy(G)
    >>> rc[0]
    1.0

    Compute the average redundancy for the graph:

    >>> sum(rc.values())/len(G)
    1.0

    Compute the average redundancy for a set of nodes:

    >>> nodes = [0, 2]
    >>> sum(rc[n] for n in nodes)/len(nodes)
    1.0
