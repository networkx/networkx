    weighted graph.

    A minimum spanning tree is a subgraph of the graph (a tree)
    with the minimum sum of edge weights.  A spanning forest is a
    union of the spanning trees for each connected component of the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph

    weight : string
       Edge data key to use for weight (default 'weight').

    data : bool, optional
       If True yield the edge data along with the edge.

    Returns
    -------
    edges : iterator
       A generator that produces edges in the minimum spanning tree.
       The edges are three-tuples (u,v,w) where w is the weight.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G=nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> G.add_edge(0,3,weight=2) # assign weight 2 to edge 0-3
    >>> mst=nx.minimum_spanning_edges(G,data=False) # a generator of MST edges
    >>> edgelist=list(mst) # make a list of the edges
    >>> print(sorted(edgelist))

    Notes
    -----
    Uses Kruskal's algorithm.

    If the graph edges do not have a weight attribute a default weight of 1
    will be used.
