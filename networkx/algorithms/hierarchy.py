def flow_hierarchy(G, weight=None):
    """Returns the flow hierarchy of a directed network.

    Flow hierarchy is defined as the fraction of edges not participating
    in cycles in a directed graph [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : DiGraph or MultiDiGraph
       A directed graph

    weight : key,optional (default=None)
       Attribute to use for node weights. If None the weight defaults to 1.

    Returns
    -------
    h : float
       Flow heirarchy value 

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm described in [1]_ computes the flow hierarchy through
    exponentiation of the adjacency matrix.  This function implements an
    alternative approach that finds strongly connected components.
    An edge is in a cycle if and only if it is in a strongly connected
    component, which can be found in `O(m)` time using Tarjan's algorithm.

def global_reaching_centrality(G, weight=None, normalized=True):
    """Returns the global reaching centrality of a directed network.

    The global reaching centrality is based on the local reaching centrality,
    which, for some node i, indicates the proportion of the graph that is
    accessible from the outgoing edges of node i. For weighted directed graphs,
    the weight is taken into account. See references for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : DiGraph

    weight : key,optional (default=None)
        Attribute to use for node weights. If None the weight defaults to 1.
        A higher weight here implies a stronger connection between nodes and
        a shorter path length.

    Returns
    -------
    h : float
        global reaching centrality

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm described in [1] computes the global reaching centrality
    by using dijkstra's shortest path finding algorithm.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G.add_edge(1, 2)
    >>> G.add_edge(1, 3)
    >>> nx.hierarchy.global_reaching_centrality(G)
    1.0
    >>> G.add_edge(3, 2)
    >>> nx.hierarchy.global_reaching_centrality(G)
    0.75
