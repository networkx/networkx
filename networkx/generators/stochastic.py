    A right-stochastic graph is a weighted digraph in which all of

    -----------
    G : directed graph
      A NetworkX DiGraph

    copy : boolean, optional

    weight : edge attribute key (optional, default='weight')
      Edge data key used for weight.  If no attribute is found for an edge
      the edge weight is set to 1.  Weights must be positive numbers.
