"""
Projective Polarity Graph Generator.

This module constructs a graph based on the projective polarity model,
where nodes are derived from a finite projective space PG(m, q) over GF(q),
and edges are added based on modular dot-product orthogonality.

The special case of m=2 produces the well-known "Erdos-Renyi (ER) polarity graph",
which is a diameter-2 graph that serves as the basis for the PolarFly
network topology.

Limitations
-----------
This version supports only prime `q` (i.e., GF(q) where q is a prime number),
due to the absence of an external Galois field library.

def _finite_field_vectors(m, q):
    r"""Generate the full finite field vector space GF(q)^(m+1).

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : int
        Projective space parameter; the vectors will be of length (m+1).
    q : int
        Prime number defining the size of the Galois Field.

    Yields
    ------
    tuple of ints
        All vectors in GF(q)^(m+1) using standard modular arithmetic.

def _normalize_projective(vector, q):
    r"""Normalize a vector in projective space over GF(q).

    Converts a vector to a canonical form by scaling so the first non-zero coordinate becomes 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vector : tuple of ints
        A vector in GF(q)^(m+1).
    q : int
        Prime number defining the field GF(q).

    Returns
    -------
    tuple of ints or None
        A normalized projective vector, or None if the input is the zero vector.

    Notes
    -----
    Normalization ensures uniqueness of projective points.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from networkx.generators.projective_polarity_prime import _normalize_projective
    >>> vector = (2, 1, 0)
    >>> _normalize_projective(vector, 3)

def _projective_space(m, q):
    r"""Generate the projective space PG(m, q) over GF(q).

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : int
        Projective space dimension.
    q : int
        Prime number defining the field GF(q).

    Returns
    -------
    list of tuples
        A list of normalized vectors representing PG(m, q) points.

    Notes
    -----
    Projective points differing by a scalar multiple are represented uniquely.
    The zero vector is excluded.

    --------

def projective_polarity_graph(m, q):
    r"""Generate an projective polarity graph from the projective space PG(m, q).

    Constructs an undirected graph where each node is a point in PG(m, q),

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : int
        Dimension of the projective space PG(m, q).
    q : int
        Prime number defining GF(q). Must be prime (not a prime power).

    G : networkx.Graph
        An undirected graph representing the projective polarity structure.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If q is not a prime number or if the resulting graph is not connected.
