"""
Unit tests for Slim Fly MMS ring-based graph construction.

This test suite includes:
- Structural tests: ensure no self-loops or duplicate edges, and expected node count.
- Connectivity test: ensure the graph is connected.
- Diameter test: verify that the diameter is small (expected 2 or close).
- Radix test: verify that node degrees are approximately regular within a bounded tolerance
Explanation about the tolerance and diameter:
When q is not a prime number (e.g., q = p^n), not all elements between 1 and q−1
are units (i.e., invertible elements in Z_q).
For powers greater than one, the graph may not be k-regular because some elements
have gcd(x, q) > 1 and do not belong to the multiplicative group Z_q*.

Example: q = 9
Elements like 3 and 6 have gcd(3,9) = 3 and gcd(6,9) = 3 → not coprime with 9.
Their powers collapse to zero:
  3^2 % 9 = 0
  6^2 % 9 = 0

These elements cannot be used to generate powers of a primitive root,
which breaks the structure of the graph.
As a result, the graph may not have diameter 2.

These tests help validate the mathematical properties and construction
logic of Slim Fly graphs over commutative rings.
