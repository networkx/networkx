# Other discrete torus expanders can be constructed by using the following edge
# sets. For more information, see Chapter 4, "Expander Graphs", in
# "Pseudorandomness", by Salil Vadhan.
#
# For a directed expander, add edges from (x, y) to:
#
#     (x, y),
#     ((x + 1) % n, y),
#     (x, (y + 1) % n),
#     (x, (x + y) % n),
#     (-y % n, x)
#
# For an undirected expander, add the reverse edges.
#
# Also appearing in the paper of Gabber and Galil:
#
#     (x, y),
#     (x, (x + y) % n),
#     (x, (x + y + 1) % n),
#     ((x + y) % n, y),

    The undirected MultiGraph is regular with degree `8`. Nodes are integer

    `p` *must* be a prime number.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : a prime number

        The number of vertices in the graph. This also indicates where the
        chordal edges in the cycle will be created.

    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
       Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.
